After coming back from China, I've been in a slump with my Chinese. Yes, I still read Chinese everyday and listen to some music, but I feel like I need a goal. A direction.

When I was in China, all the new Chinese came easy. It was like I was on autopilot with improving my Chinese. Now... it's effort. However, I did not feel it before. I guess it comes from getting things easy. What g0es up must come down.

But besides that, I feel like I'm reaching a point where my vocabulary acquisition is reaching diminishing returns. If I learn new words, like for instance I learned 讲究 the other day. It means "to pay particular attention to" or "exquisite". Now, that's a cool word right, but really how much is it used. I'm scared of learning words that are really obscure, which will make me end up sounding like a pompous speaker.

I think next should be learning more vocabulary that are certain areas of interest. I want to brush up on web/tech vocabulary, 'cause it is an area that interests me, but could also be valuable for future job prospects. It's just hard to find something functional after I have been in China. There it was like this: I need to book an apartment. Check up in dictionary some words. Use them.

In some good news though, Billy from <a href="http://studymorechinese.com">StudymoreChinese</a> has a daily sentence challenge going. He posts words, usually two of them and you have to make a sentence. I quite enjoy this. Takes about 5min everyday and people help each other and read other sentences. Rather nifty. Follow <a href="http://studymorechinese.com/group/daily-chinese-sentence">this group</a> to join in.

Also, I'm busy redesigning <a href="http://socialmandarin.com">Social Mandarin</a> on my own. I know some CSS and PHP, but its a nice challenge. It is going good!
