I don't normally cross-post my creative projects, but this one is relevant to my China travels this year. While I'm not doing research, learning Chinese, browsing the web and a million other things, I compose music. Sometimes really strange music. Like 8-bit music or otherwise known as chiptunes. I use a Game Boy. You can see me using it in the <a href="http://confusedlaowai.com/about">about page</a>.

I started writing this song while chilling in the hostel at nights in Shanghai. Every so often while on my travels (usually commuting) I'd continue writing it. I also remember sitting on my apartment balcony in Xiamen looking at the ocean and people below and writing away.

In the future I'll hopefully write some tracks with vocals... in Chinese :) You'll be the first to hear it!
