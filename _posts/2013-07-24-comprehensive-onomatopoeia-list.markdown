<em>Today on Confused Laowai, I’m featuring a post by Christina from FluentU. In case you are unfamiliar with them, they’re a language learning company that uses authentic video for personalized language learning. You can check them out <a href="http://fluentu.com">here</a>.</em>

Ever want to type “haha” or “boom!” during a conversation but you pause and think, “wait, how do you write this word?”. I’ve been there many times and always feel that without the onomatopoeia, my sentence loses a bit of the exact meaning I want to communicate. From reading <a title="Onomatopoeia in Chinese" href="http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/06/onomatopoeia-chinese/">Niel’s post on onomatopoeia</a>, it gave me inspiration to look further into more Chinese onomatopoeias.

Just how do you say “woof” when a dog barks? How do you express the sound of the ping pong ball bouncing back and forth on the table? After looking through the internet and much research, I wanted to share some of the information I found.

You would never be able to visit a zoo or sing Old McDonald’s without these: animal sounds!

The reason I looked into this was because I was texting one of my Chinese friends about my morning. I woke up to the sound my neighbor’s dog barking consistently for fifteen minutes at a squirrel. I wanted to text them “woof” for extra measure but didn’t know how to so had to look it up. Turns out, to say “woof” in Chinese, is “wang” in pinyin.

Here’s how you can use this word: “我邻居的狗不停地叫，汪汪汪!” - “My neighbor’s dog didn’t stop barking, woof, woof, woof!”

They’re so useful in many occasions, here are some more onomatopoeias for animals!
<h3>Animal Sounds</h3>
嗥/嚎 (háo) - awoo; howl吼 (hǒu) - roar
哞 (mōu) - moo
布谷 (bù gǔ) - cuckoo; chirp
嗷呜 (áo wū) - growl
嗯昂 (ēn áng) - hee haw
吱吱 (zhī zhī) - tweet
咩咩 (miē miē) - baah; bleating
喵喵 (miāo miāo) - meow
咯咯 (gē gē) - cluck
哼哼 (hēng hēng) - oink
嗡嗡 (wēng wēng) - buzz; hum
嘶嘶 (sī sī) - hiss
嘶嘶 (sī sī) - neigh
吱吱 (zhī zhī) - squeak
汪汪 (wāng wāng) - woof
嘎嘎 (gā gā) - quack
咕咕 (gū gū) - coo
呱呱 (guā guā) - ribbit
唧唧 (jī jī) - chirping of insects
呜呜 (wū wū) - hoot; loud raucous cry (like an owl)
叽叽喳喳 (jī ji chā chā) - chirp
喔喔喔 (ō ō ō) - cock-a-doodle-doo; crow

One of the most versatile one character expressions, and my personal favorite is “啪 (pā)” or similar to “pop!” in English. However, you could use it in so many situations and depending on the situation, the meaning doesn’t directly translate into “pop”.

For example, when joking with my friends and pretending that I’d smack them for an inappropriate joke, I can make the motion of hitting (but purposely missing) them while saying “啪!” If you do a couple of slaps, say three back and forths then say “啪,啪,啪!”

Though the first example is the most common way to use this word, another way to use “啪” can be describing something that’s fallen. “我的手机啪就掉下马桶了” or “My cell phone fell into the toilet, plat!”

When walking on the street and all of a sudden you see an interesting sign that is hanging in the window of a shop you can say “我走在马路上的时候，啪，就看到了标记” meaning “When I was walking on the street, voila, I saw the sign.”

I could go on and on with more examples but basically, I haven’t found a situation (though there are some) where I couldn’t use this word! Below you’ll find some other one character onomatopoeias.
<h3>One Character Onomatopoeias</h3>
啊 (à) - ah!
啊 (á) - huh?
诶 (éi) - eh?
呀 (ya) - eek!
哇 (wa) - wow!
啪 (pā) - pop!
哦 (ó) - oh?
哦 (ò) - oh!
嗬 (hē) - hoy!
唷 (yō) - yo
唉 (ài) - alas
吁 (yù) - sigh
呃 (è) - er
啦 (la) - la
嘘 (xū) - hush
呸 (pēi) - bah
嘭 (pēng) - Boom!

After spending a year in China, I’ve become a lot more Chinese with my expressions and natural reactions.

Before living in the Far East, if I forgot something or if I would drop something I’d say “ah!” or “oh crap!” Well, now instead I say “哎呀!” which means “oops!” in Chinese.

A great way to express surprise or “whoa!” would be 哇塞 (wa sāi). You can use this is together with “厉害” (powerful;strong). One of my coworkers went to work only wearing a t-shirt when it was 50 degrees out to teach his class. All the students told him “哇塞, 好厉害!” or “Whoa! So strong!”

Here are some more two character onomatopoeias in Chinese.
