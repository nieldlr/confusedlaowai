I have created a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confused-Laowai/119051224867760">Facebook page.</a> Join me there too. I'll be posting lots of other links (not just my blog!) to interesting China stories and content. Sometimes I just like engaging with people on Facebook. <a href="http://twitter.com/confusedlaowai">Twitter</a> is a little limiting sometimes.

Hmmm. So yes, that's all I wanted to say, but I hate wasting this delicious blog post space with just those links. Wait I know! Here is a video of Tsingtao beer and what makes Chinese Beer culture awesome:
