Steven, from <a href="http://lingomi.com">Lingomi</a>, posted a <a href="http://socialmandarin.com/General/An_RPG_Scorecard_for_Mandarin_Chinese">link on Social Mandarin</a>, showcasing his idea of assesing one's levels in Chinese. I quite like the idea, being a gamer and RPG fan. There should be better and more in-depth assessment categories. This can be both encouraging and discouraging if you try to fit yourself into the framework. I decided to give it a go. These are guesses mostly on my part. But a fun exercise nonetheless.

<strong>Character (Writing)</strong> - By hand: Level 3 (250 Characters) -  By PC: Level 5 (1000).

<strong>Character (Reading)</strong> - Level 7 (2000 Characters). I'd say I'm very close to Level 8.

<strong>Chinese Vocabulary</strong> - Level 5 (1500). The gap between 5-6 is quite big, but I went for a conservative estimate. [I tested myself on a <a href="http://www.zhtoolkit.com/apps/wordtest/">site that estimates one's vocabulary</a> and I was completely off. My estimate is 4135! Thus I've leveled up to 6. Try the test yourself.]

<strong>Chinese Grammar</strong> - Level 6 (Newspaper 2). Although my vocabulary is still lacking, I've got quite a good grasp of Chinese grammar.

<strong>Spoken Chinese</strong> - Level 6. Once again, I can string sentences easily together, but my downfall is a solid vocabulary and sometimes those complex sentences.

<strong>Chinese Listening</strong> - Level 5? Steven points out the difficulty with the listening levels. I think there are ways to track it. For instance, you can only listen to slow speech, or unaccented clear pronunciation moving towards native like speed and accents. I would put myself into where I can understand quite a few sentences if spoken slowly, but native-like speed and functional elements I still struggle with. Furthermore, when watching a TV series I still rely a lot on the subtitles to get the full meaning.

Where would you put yourself? Head on <a href="http://lingomi.com/blog/2011/04/an-rpg-scorecard-for-mandarin-chinese/">over to the post</a> and score yourself.
