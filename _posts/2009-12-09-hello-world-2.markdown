Welcome to Confused LaoWai (糊涂的老外). This blog will document my misleading adventures in learning Mandarin. Hopefully this will help you, and in turn I hope I can help myself (please!?). So, please join in on the posts and let's get Mandarin a run for it's money. I think this <a href="http://chinesepod.com/community/conversations/post/6294">post by Simon Pettersson</a> sums up the attitude everyone needs to have:
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">You're afraid, aren't you, Mandarin? You're starting to feel it; the cold sweat trickling down your back. You heard I kicked English's ass already at 12, and you witnessed first hand what I did to French. French is my b*tch now. And I'm coming for you, Mandarin.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">I know you fancy yourself the biggest, meanest language in town. I know you beat the snot out of most anyone who comes to take you on. Hell, you even gave me a sound asswhooping once that caused me to give you space for quite some time. But I'm not like the others. I'm not giving up, and with every day I grow stronger. You ain't never met anyone like me, Mandarin. And you're starting to realize it.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">Any obstacle you throw in my way, I can overcome. You tried to run, but you could feel me closing in on you. Now you're trying to hide, but I can hear you breathing. I'm coming for you and when I catch up, it ain't gonna be pretty. I'll wrestle you to the ground and beat you into submission. You'll be begging for mercy before this is over, Mandarin.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">You've beat me up bad so many times, yet I keep coming back for more, each time a little bit stronger. Because I'm Muy Macho, and I can give as good as I get. You're winning the battles, but I'm winning the war.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">You see me coming, don't you? And you're afraid. You should be, Mandarin. You should be.</p>
