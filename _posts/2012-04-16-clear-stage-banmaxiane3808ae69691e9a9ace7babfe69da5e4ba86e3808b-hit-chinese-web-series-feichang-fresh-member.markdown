I just watched the first part of a web series called Clear the Stage for Banmaxian (《斑马线来了》). The creator is Antoine Shapiro, the same guy who's part of <a href="http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/08/feichang-fresh-repeat/" title="Feichang Fresh on repeat">Feichang Fresh</a>.

It got 650, 000 views on it's first day on <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzgxMTk1OTE2.html">Youku</a>. I'm seriously impressed. Feichang Fresh sings some of my favourite Chinese songs. Now Antoine has created another awesome Chinese show!? Who are these guys. Their Chinese is amazing. The show itself is also really good, with romance, friendships, dreams and music. Now if these laowai are not inspiring, then I don't know what is.
