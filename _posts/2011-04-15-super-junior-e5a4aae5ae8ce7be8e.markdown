I'm a sucker for Chinese pop songs. Super Junior M, although being a side project of the massively huge Korean group Super Junior, are up my alley of feel good tunes. They remind me a lot of N'sync. I guess these guys fall into the guilty pleasure area. I found a new tune called 太完美. I just have to share it as it has been on repeat here at my side. Lyrics to follow after video.

<strong>Chinese:</strong>

她迷住我视线 她迷住我视线 
在爱情里的宝藏被我发现 
你就是我寻找的稀世宝贝 
你就不断地在正反我世界 
连冰块遇见你都燃起火焰 
太过心急不对 
用力爱会碎 
太过缓慢不对 
我随你进或退 
Oh太完美 你眼里我出现 
Oh不让谁 替我在你身边 Woo Wo u O 
你的眉眼 你的侧脸 你的颈间 
你的嫵媚 你的一切 从头到尾 
我已沦陷 
我的心变成了口袋的一面 
Just For You不停地给 不停地给 
这样子爱你到底是对不对 
我一边疑惑 一边更加迷恋 
太过心急不对 
用力爱会碎 
太过缓慢不对 
我随你进或退 
Oh太完美 你眼裡我出现 
Oh不让谁 替我在你身边 Woo Wo u O 
你的眉眼 你的侧脸 你的颈间 
你的嫵媚 你的一切 从头到尾 
我已沦陷 

Oh太完美 Oh不让谁
Oh太完美 
每次见面是脉搏就当机了 
他在我全身狂跳不由己 
一直跳 一直跳 想见你 
一直跳 一直跳 喜欢你 
一直跳 一直跳 都是你 
一直跳 一直跳 我爱你 
一直跳 一直跳 一直跳 一直跳 
太过心急不对 
用力爱会碎 
太过缓慢不对 
我随你进或退 
Oh太完美 你眼里我出现 
Oh不让谁 替我在你身边 Woo Wo u O 
你的眉眼 你的侧脸 你的颈间 
你的嫵媚 你的一切 从头到尾 
我已沦陷 
Bounce to the music let your feet go round
To the floor and I’ma break it down 
Let me in let me show you all my bling bling 
And all my kicks kicks baby dance with me 
Boom Boom Boom
Can I get another clap clap clap lets go 
shake your body move your body pick your feet up 
I’ma move to the groove baby I’ma go all out 
给我说 你想我 给我说 你爱我 
给我说 你想我 说你想我 给我说 你爱我 
给我说 你想我 给我说 你爱我 
给我说 你想我 给我说 你想我 给我说 你爱我

<strong>English Translation (my own + video's interpretation):</strong>

She captivated my line of sight, she captivated my line of sight.
I've discovered love's treasure
You are that rare treasure I've been searching for
You continuously turn my world upside down
Even ice cubes bursts into flames when it meets you

Being too impatient is wrong, if you push love it will break
Being too slow is wrong, I'll sway with you whether you come or go.

Oh too perfect, I appear in your eyes.
I won't let anyone replace me at your side

Your looks, your profile, your neck and shoulders,
Your charm, your everything, from head to toe.
I've already fallen for you.

My heart has turned into my pocket's side.
Just for you, I endlessly give, I endlessly give.
Is loving you like this right or wrong?
I'm doubtful and even more infatuated with you at the same time.
 
Oh too perfect, I appear in your eyes.
I won't let anyone replace me at your side

Your looks, your profile, your neck and shoulders,
Your charm, your everything, from head to toe.
I've already fallen for you.

Oh too perfect, oh won't let anyone
Oh too perfect

Every time I see you my heart skips a beat
My whole body jumps uncontrollably wild.

It jumps, it beats, I want to see you.
It skips, it bounces, I like you.
It rocks, it dances, all because of you.
It pulses, it pulses, I love you.
It beats, it beats, it beats, it beats.

Oh too perfect, I appear in your eyes.
I won't let anyone replace me at your side

Your looks, your profile, your neck and shoulders,
Your charm, your everything, from head to toe.
I've already fallen for you.

Bounce to the music let your feet go round
To the floor and I’ma break it down
Let me in let me show you all my bling bling
And all my kicks kicks baby dance with me
Boom Boom Boom
Can I get another clap clap clap lets go
shake your body move your body pick your feet up
I’ma move to the groove baby I’ma go all out

Tell me you want me, tell me you love me.
Tell me you want me, tell me you love me.
Tell me you want me, tell me you love me.
Tell me you want me, tell me you love me.
