Last year, I took part in the Chinese Bridge competition, which is a Chinese Proficiency competition for foreigners. My Chinese was a bit bad back then, but part of the competition included a "culture" section. You could do anything Chinese really. Sing a song, say a poem, tell a story, do calligraphy or dancing whatever. I decided early on I'd sing a song.

I didn't know any Chinese songs back then, so I Googled quite a lot to find a suitable song. I was looking for a nice acoustic tune so that I could play it on guitar. I then found 崔健's 花房姑娘. Translated as Greenhouse Girl, I immediately fell in love with this song. I got the tabs for the song and furiously went to learning it.

It took me quite some time to get the lyrics memorized, which I did completely wrong by the way. I learned the syllables and not what the lyrics actually meant. Which meant that I got extremely frustrated in learning the song. Nevertheless I managed to learn most of the lines before the competition. Along with my guitar I did a solid performance. Although my speech and test (other parts of the competition) didn't go so well, I didn't win anything. But that is fine with me, I had a wonderful time and learned a brilliant song.

Little did I know that a year later my girlfriend would come to me saying that they are learning a song in Chinese (she just finished her first year in Chinese, same University). I was intrigued and she said something about a girl and flowers. My instincts proved right when I looked at the lyrics. This song has now become a song that embodies my Chinese learning experience and something that I share with my girlfriend. Incidentally her Chinese name is 白花 and her real life name is Saffron. She is indeed my 花房姑娘.

I keep listening to this song, even though I haven't listened to much other songs of 崔健. 一无所有 is also another great song of his. I'm going to try and learn to play 花房姑娘 again and maybe I'll upload a cover song (翻唱) on Youtube. Here are the lyrics and a Youtube video of a live performance. Enjoy!

崔健 - 花房姑娘

我独自走过你身旁,并没有话要对你讲,
我不敢抬头看着你的,噢......脸庞.
你问我要去向何方,我指着大海的方向,
你的惊奇像是给我,噢......赞扬.

你带我走进你的花房,我无法逃脱花的迷香,
我不知不觉忘记了,噢......方向,
你说我世上最坚强,我说你世上最善良,
你不知不觉已和花儿,噢......一样

你要我留在这地方,你要我和它们一样,
我看着你默默地说,噢......不能这样,
我想要回到老地方,我想要走在老路上,
我明知我已离不开你!噢......姑娘!
我就要回到老地方,我就要走在老路上,
我明知我已离不开你!噢......姑娘

Alone I walk past you
But have nothing to say
I dare not raise my head to look at your
(oh!) Face
You ask me where I'm heading
I point to the ocean
Your surprise seems to give me
(oh!) Praise
You ask me where I'm heading
I point to the ocean

You lead me into your greenhouse
I am intoxicated by the fragrance
And without realizing it I forget my
(oh!) Destination
You say that I am the strongest in the world
I say you are the kindest in the world
And gradually the flower and I become
(oh!) One
You say that I am the strongest in the world
I say you are the kindest in the world

You want me to stay here
You want me to be like them
I look at you and silently say that's
(oh!) Impossible
I wish I could return to that old place
I wish I could walk down that old road
But only then do I realize I can't leave you
(oh!) Girl
I will return to that old place
I will walk down that old road
Even though I'm sure I can't leave you
(oh!) Girl
