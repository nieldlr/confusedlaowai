As you know I'll be in China from 22 June till 11 July. Three weeks of China goodness. I arrive in <strong>Shanghai </strong>on the 22nd of June. I'll spend a few nights there till 28 June at Old West Gate International Youth Hostel. I'm keen for some<strong> recommendations</strong> on what to see and what to do in Shanghai. I have some ideas, but would like to hear if you have something interesting. To be honest, China is so awesome, I don't even mind walking around for the whole day, just taking everything in and missioning around. There might be a <strong>reddit meetup</strong> that weekend. Keen to join that just for the fun!

On the 28th I'll be heading to <strong>Xiamen</strong> to visit my girlfriend, who's also studying there on a summer school. I'm not sure how long I'll stay there though, but a minimum for a week. Then I might head to the more chilled areas and see the landscapes (maybe Guilin/Yangshou) or head to Beijing to visit a friend. Either way, I'll be back in <strong>Shanghai on Monday the 11th July</strong>, because I fly back on the Tuesday 12 June.

I'll try my best to blog while I'm there. I got myself a notebook to<strong> keep a diary</strong> and write down characters and words that I learn while there. I'm planning to maximise my learning in China.
