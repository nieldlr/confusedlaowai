First things first. I have found this <a href="http://engkoo.com">excellent new dictionary site</a> that pulls examples from the internet! It has a really slick interface. Go check it out.

In other news, I'm still actively developing <a href="http://socialmandarin.com">Social Mandarin</a>. A recent new feature that has been added, is the possibility to have your own blog on Social Mandarin. This will allow other users to more easily share their personal stories and anecdotes on learning Mandarin. Read more info on it <a href="http://socialmandarin.com/get_blogging_xieboke">here</a>. If you are a learner, please consider joining and sharing your stories and progress. We can learn from each other.

I'm going <a href="http://socialmandarin.com/blog/confused_laowai">to blog on Social Mandarin</a> as well now, but it will be more formal. It will most of the times be as an acting admin, asking questions concerning Mandarin and how people experience Mandarin and the site. I might also talk about interesting words, formal progress and asking for critique on my writing and other things. This site will still continue with the same kind of questions and ideas I have about Mandarin. Such as <a href="http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/07/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-chinese/">How Long does it take to learn Chinese</a>. There might be some cross posting in the future, but I will try not to.

So go on! Join if you want!
