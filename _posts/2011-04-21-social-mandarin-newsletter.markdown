Just quick update on <a href="http://socialmandarin.com">Social Mandarin.</a>

I've finally created a newsletter for Social Mandarin. It will feature the excellent links from the site and some more Mandarin goodies. It will go out every two weeks. If you want to stay up-to-date with Chinese and learn at the same time, please subscribe!

You can do so by <a href="http://socialmandarin.com">visiting the site</a> and subscribing by adding your email address in the left sidebar. I've some exciting ideas for it and will greatly appreciate if you sign up. The first edition is going out <strong>tomorrow (Friday 22nd April)</strong>, so subscribe now!

谢谢,
