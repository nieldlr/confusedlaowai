I've decided to sporadically blog on all the great Mandarin learning posts I come across recently.

First up is Albert from <a href="http://laowaichinese.net/">Laowai Chinese</a>. He posted a <a href="http://laowaichinese.net/n%C7%90-h%C7%8Eo-%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD-a-very-fake-greeting.htm">blog post on 你好 being a misleading greeting.</a> In my experience, many of my Chinese 朋友 and 老师 use 你好 often, but that's probably 'cause of the Western environment. Today, I heard an older Chinese women greet one of my friends like this: 你现在上课了吗？ Meaning do you have class now? This seemed like an interesting greeting. It's very similar to 吃了吗 discussed in Albert's post, in the way that context determines the greeting. I reckon 3-4 in the afternoon would be an odd time to ask 吃了吗？I all else fails, I reckon you can fall back on greeting someone determined by the time of day: 早上好，下午好，晚上好。

Another blog post is a guest post by Megan on Charlie's blog <a href="http://discoveringmandarin.blogspot.com/">Discovering Mandarin</a>. She comments on the trouble with Mandarin pronunciation <a href="http://discoveringmandarin.blogspot.com/2010/02/learnign-mandarin-pronunciation.html">concerning x &amp; q versus sh &amp; ch</a>. At first I was also baffled by the the differences, especially those pairs, but also the difference between zh and ch. Here studying linguistics helped me a lot. I did a module in phonetics and the difference between those two became very easy for me to distinguish. Without going into technical details the range of j -&gt; q -&gt; x and zh -&gt; ch -&gt; sh have the same principle in mind in terms of releasing air. The best way to practice these sets is to add an 'i' to it. ji &amp; zhi have very little air released. Hold your hand in front of your mouth. You will feel a small puff of air. Now qi &amp; chi have a strong initial puff of air but then it stops. This is called delayed release. xi &amp; shi throughout their pronunciation doesn't stop the flow of air. I hope you understand.

Then one post for the intermediate folk from John on <a href="http://www.sinosplice.com/">Sinosplice</a>: it's on the <a href="http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2010/02/02/the-3-2-tone-swap-error">3-2 tone error swap.</a> At first I gave a blind eye to tone errors, as I felt that I've not even begun to master tones normally, but since reading his post, I've given attention to my tone usage, especially the 3-2 tone error. Really informative. Also, Sinosplice has had a redesign so go check it out. The site is an amazing source of Mandarin tips and China in general.
