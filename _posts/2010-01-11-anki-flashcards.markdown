This year I want to complement my Mandarin University studies with more self-study. One of the things I've stumbled upon is<a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/"> Anki.</a> It's a flashcard program that uses SRS. I quote the description: "Anki is a spaced repetition system (SRS). It helps you remember things by intelligently scheduling flashcards, so that you can learn a lot of information with a minimum amount of effort". It's a pretty nifty program. I use it now every day. You can download decks from inside the program. I downloaded two HSK decks and I'm doing them both.

I'll keep you guys updated on the progress.
