Last week, a few professors from Beijing JiaoTong University visited <a href="http://ml.sun.ac.za">the lab</a> I'm doing research at. I was nervous the whole week as I knew I'd have to talk in Chinese to them. I hardly get speaking practice in South Africa, which I know is my worst ability in Chinese at the moment! I looked up a lot technical terms yesterday, which I didn't even end up using when I talked. Yes, I'm nervous like that! Haha.

That's me in the checkered top talking to the professors. You may notice the person in the forefront with earphones around his neck, that's <a href="http://simondlr.com">my twin brother </a>(we both work in the same lab. He's doing research into social networks and information overload).

The conversation with the professors went quite smoothly in the end. I explained most of research, how I want to help learners Chinese learn characters better and how I think that radicals are an important of the Chinese script (they would know of course!). I left out some other stuff, like flashcards and spaced repetition, but I'm glad as even that in English is hard to explain to people!

They asked if I have something to demo. I showed them my <a href="http://hanzijs.com">HanziJS</a> decomposition tool. It worked fine, but then they asked to try the character 姜. When I saw it, I immediately recognized seeing this character before and knew that this character would test <a href="http://groovy.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=cjk-decomp">the data</a> I got from Gavin Grover. It returned this:

Woops! The top part should be  ⺷! But here's the interesting thing. I did a bit more research into this. The top component should actually be 羊 as this was part of the historic development of 姜. However, here's the cool part, ⺷  is to 羊 as 氵 is to 水. Meaning that it is the form of the radical that is not stand-alone and only occurs fixed with a character.

So how does one actually decode 姜? I asked <a href="http://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/1612/what-is-the-top-part-of-%E5%A7%9C-and-why-does-it-differ/">this question on the Chinese Stack Exchange</a>. Technically it should be ⺷ + 女, because when 羊 as a radical occurs at the top of the character, it should  be ⺷. In my opinion, I think one should stick to showing 羊, because it works as familiar phonetic radical that aids in the pronunciation 姜 (Jiāng) as it has the same rhyme.
