It's been a day now since I got back from my three week trip to China. I don't think I'm over my jetlag yet though. I have come back with interesting stories and lots of Mandarin I learned. It's been an eye opener. I've got lots of blog posts to write, ranging from my impressions of Shanghai to my experience in using Mandarin. From next week you'll seeing them going up. I'll also report back on my Mandarin Research Assignment among some other revelations I found while travelling and being immersed in Chinese again.
