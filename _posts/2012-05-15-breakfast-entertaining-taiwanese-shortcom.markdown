Herman (from <a title="Introducing ChineseLevel – Test your Chinese Reading" href="http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/02/introducing-chineselevel-test-chinese-reading/">ChineseLevel</a>) linked this on his Facebook a week or so ago. BreakFAST! It's a short sitcom style comedy (hence the name shortcom) surrounding the lives of people in Taiwan. It's short, funny, entertaining and has a nice upbeat atmosphere to it. Also it makes me hungry every time I watch an episode.

There are currently 4 episodes online. I quite like the second episode. Check out the Shakespeare soliloquy in Chinese and the fail of the instant translator app. The Chinese has a strong Taiwanese accent to it, which isn't that bad if you're used to watching Taiwanese soaps or dramas. Otherwise it's not that hard to follow, especially with the English subtitles helping you along. Enjoy!
