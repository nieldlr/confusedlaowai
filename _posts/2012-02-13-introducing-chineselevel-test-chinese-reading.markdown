Ah, the digital age is upon us. I think Chinese learning, and language learning in general is getting very exciting lately. It became even more exciting, when I received a tweet, this weekend, from an acquaintance studying in Taiwan at the moment. His wife went with me on my <a title="My Trip to Beijing June ’09" href="http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/05/my-trip-to-beijing-june-09/">trip to Beijing in 2009</a>. Without further ado, I introduce <a href="http://chineselevel.com">ChineseLevel</a>.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837342/Screen-Shot-2012-02-13-at-11_11_30-AM_yglzyj.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-833" title="ChineseLevel" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837342/Screen-Shot-2012-02-13-at-11_11_30-AM_yglzyj.png" alt="" width="626" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It offers a quick test, that tracks how many words you know. Apparently I can read 80% of newspapers! The site then recommends you articles based on your level. That's the initial core functionality of it. Having only just launched, a bright future lies ahead for ChineseLevel. <a href="http://www.ironzebra.com/">Herman Schaaf</a>, the creator of the site, did some research himself into reading Chinese newspapers. Check out his <a href="http://chineselevel.com/words/stats/">research results</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I feel there's a lot more to add in terms of features, but it's a slick design and great offering for an initial launch. Be sure to sign up and keep track of <a href="http://chineselevel.com">ChineseLevel</a>. Another site that I've been beta testing, <a href="http://3000hanzi.com">3000hanzi</a>, by Steven of <a href="http://lingomi.com">Lingomi</a>, is also looking for a launch this week. They've got similar ideas, aiding learners with Chinese reading development. We all know that is a tough job! Here's to a brighter Chinese future. And hopefully we'll be reading Chinese newspapers in no time.</p>
