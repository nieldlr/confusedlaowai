My inner linguistic nerd is going crazy right now. <a href="http://sinoglot.com/blog/2012/04/new-linguistic-corpus-of-sina-weibo-messages/">This post </a>released today from a member of Sinoglot, Daan, reveals that he has created a large Weibo corpus. For those not familiar with term, a corpus is a large body/collectinos of text, often used in linguistic research to study trends, frequency, discoure analysis and other interesting data.
<blockquote>The LWC is an annotated linguistic 100-million word corpus containing 5.1 million messages from Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like microblogging service. It’s freely available online at <a href="http://lwc.daanvanesch.nl/">http://lwc.daanvanesch.nl/</a>.</blockquote>

I'm a sucker for context lately. Whenever I want to see how a word is used, I go straight to <a href="http://jukuu.com">Jukuu.com</a>, instead trying to find the meaning boundaries with a dictionary. This tool by Daan will be an awesome new arsenal in contextual information, especially colloquial online writing. There are some useful stat pages as well, like a <a href="http://lwc.daanvanesch.nl/frequentwords.php">frequency list</a>. It will be interesting to see how this differs other frequency lists. I already see a word, 分享, popping in at number 50 that you won't find in other corpuses that high up, like <a href="http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/bigram/form.php">Jun Da's fiction corpus</a>. 分享 means to share. You'll see it everywhere on Weibo and social networking websites. Almost like retweet from Twitter.

Have a look around and start exploring. I'll bet you'll find something interesting.
