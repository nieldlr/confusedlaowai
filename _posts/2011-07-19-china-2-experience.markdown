So, like some of you know, I went to China for three weeks from<strong> 21 June to 12 July</strong>. This is my second time going to China. I went on an International Summer School to Beijing June/July 2009. This time around, I got a very different experience of China. One that left me <strong>almost disheartened at the country</strong> and my love and passion for its culture, which is a big motivation for me learning Chinese. However, I see this as part of the<strong> growing pains</strong> with coming to accept such a vastly different culture. Allow me to explain.

Back in 2008, when I started learning Chinese, I would never have thought all these <strong>opportunities and personal development</strong> would come my way. I thought this it was interesting language and wanted to learn another foreign language. I've never done it before, little did I know what an interesting relationship would arise.

Learning another language has been an amazing journey, especially with Mandarin, because of its vastly different culture. They say, with acquiring a new language, <strong>one acquires a new soul</strong>. This is very much true and this is part of the growing pains I'm talking about. I've been mostly hidden from Chinese culture through my now three &amp; half years of learning Chinese. In 2009 when I went to Beijing, I loved it. The culture was awesome. The people great, but now I realize, that wasn't a China experience.

I was surrounded by classmates, by other international students and a safe University campus environment. We went to foreign student hangouts and drank with expats. By all means, this was<strong> international experience in China</strong>. Although I was exposed to China, I was left with big comfort zone still.

Now this time around. I went alone. I had to fend for myself... in China. With China. This was a new shock for me. One that I wasn't very much prepared for. <strong>Learning Chinese comes with the culture</strong>. There is no other way about it. All language learners undergo a certain amount of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation">enculturation</a>.

Learning Chinese has not only been a challenge with the language, but also my own beliefs of cultural truths. In a way learning Chinese, has brought me to breakdown my own ethnocentric ideas. This is what I experienced in China this time around, but a lot more in my face. I was constantly trying to <strong>dissect my ideas against China's culture</strong>. Obvious examples being, the spitting in streets, to more bigger ideals such an ever present communist presence (和谐 is everywhere). My initial reaction was a knee-jerk disagreement with everything that didn't sit well with me. This made me disheartened. I almost felt as if my passion for China and Chinese was dying right in front of my eyes.

<strong>But.</strong>

Then it got better. Like most things time is what it takes. I realized that for me to develop not only as a language learner, but as a person, this <strong>exposure to another culture is essential for development</strong>. No-one said it was going to be an easy ride. For some it is, but for me, it was tougher that I expected. That was almost another surprise, that I thought I knew China. But I didn't. It was a shock. I know now, that I'm even far more away from understanding China than ever before. This trip taught me much humility. But it inspired me as well. I'll have to <strong>go back to China</strong> in the future after my studies. Get the culture and language under my belt. This is the journey or the 道 I'm destined for.

There is still much to be learned.
