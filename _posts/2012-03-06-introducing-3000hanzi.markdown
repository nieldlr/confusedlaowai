I'm just loving how more and more awesome sites are popping up in the digital Chinese learning space lately. <a href="http://3000hanzi.com">3000Hanzi</a> is the next resource that's helping learners with reading Chinese. It not only has a great online reading system, where you can add links or text, but also has annotation, word frequency and more.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837340/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-10_34_07-AM_nkfepg.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-852" title="3000Hanzi" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837340/Screen-Shot-2012-03-06-at-10_34_07-AM_nkfepg.png" alt="" width="589" height="379" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was created by Steven Daniels, who is no stranger to the online Mandarin learning community, as he is behind <a href="http://lingomi.com">Lingomi</a>Â too. I've only recently started using 3000Hanzi, and so far I'm impressed. I see a good future for 3000Hanzi as Steven is diligent developer and learner. His <a href="http://lingomi.com/blog/">blog</a> shows that. I'm not going to an in-depth review of the site as this only an introduction.</p>

Here's a video that explains more:
