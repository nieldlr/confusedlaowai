I use a Nokia E51 which uses the S60 operating system. I've been looking all over the web for great dictionary tools so I can carry a pocket sized one with me. I often see something and wonder how does one say this in Chinese? I could write it down, but I wan't to know it at that moment. I thus wanted a simple application for my phone. After quite some searching I found <a href="http://www.getjar.com/mobile/11249/dictionary-for-mids-english-chinese-for-nokia-e51/">this</a>, "Dictionary for MIDs English-Chinese"

If the link is giving you problems, just follow these instructions:

1) Got the <a href="http://m.getjar.com/" rel="nofollow">m.getjar.com</a>
2) Go to the bottom page and go to "Quick Download"
3) Enter the code 11249

Plus points:
<ul>
	<li>Fits on your phone, that's not a iPhone.</li>
	<li>Gives pinyin, traditional and simplified 汉字.</li>
	<li>Thorough dictionary.</li>
	<li>Free!</li>
</ul>
Negative points:
<ul>
	<li>A little slow.</li>
	<li>Fonts a bit small.</li>
	<li>Settings a little weird.</li>
	<li>Chinese to English translation is a bit more difficult, as you need to know pinyin correctly as well.</li>
</ul>
As a free application I would recommend it. It's still not great, it could use some improvement, but for now it works really great! It's also open-source! What do you think of this app? Do you have any other applications to recommend?

P.S. - If your phone can't display characters naturally, choose Bitmap font in the settings.
