This blog will document my misleading\nadventures in learning Mandarin. Hopefully this will help you, and in turn I\nhope I can help myself (please!?). So, please join in on the posts and let's get\nMandarin a run for it's money. I think this post by Simon Pettersson\n[http://chinesepod.com/community/conversations/post/6294]  sums up the attitude\neveryone needs to have:\n\nYou're afraid, aren't you, Mandarin? You're starting to feel it; the cold sweat\ntrickling down your back. You heard I kicked English's ass already at 12, and\nyou witnessed first hand what I did to French. French is my b*tch now. And I'm\ncoming for you, Mandarin.\n\nI know you fancy yourself the biggest, meanest language in town. I know you beat\nthe snot out of most anyone who comes to take you on. Hell, you even gave me a\nsound asswhooping once that caused me to give you space for quite some time. But\nI'm not like the others. I'm not giving up, and with every day I grow stronger.\nYou ain't never met anyone like me, Mandarin. And you're starting to realize it.\n\nAny obstacle you throw in my way, I can overcome. You tried to run, but you\ncould feel me closing in on you. Now you're trying to hide, but I can hear you\nbreathing. I'm coming for you and when I catch up, it ain't gonna be pretty.\nI'll wrestle you to the ground and beat you into submission. You'll be begging\nfor mercy before this is over, Mandarin.\n\nYou've beat me up bad so many times, yet I keep coming back for more, each time\na little bit stronger. Because I'm Muy Macho, and I can give as good as I get.\nYou're winning the battles, but I'm winning the war.\n\nYou see me coming, don't you? And you're afraid. You should be, Mandarin.

When I sit on QQ and someone says something I don't understand, I quickly copy past it into MDBG's translate option, which combines Google Translate with it's own categorizing of words.

IChaCha definitely wins in the examples department. It is amazingly helpful, especially if you are unsure of how to use a certain word.  It provides examples of how to use the search term in other contexts, for example: I searched to swim (游泳) and it gave me the option to use dive/swimming stroke (游泳动作).

The mistakes I made, might not be mine particularly, but perhaps the way our course is structured. However, these mistakes can be applied to anyone starting to learn Mandarin. These \\\"mistakes\\\" are not necessarily bad, but it's part of  my current shortcomings in Mandarin that I still struggle with. Perhaps you can learn from me and try to fill those gaps earlier on.\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Tones are part of the word\\r\\n\\r\\nI grasped the tones really easy. I could pronounce separate words when I read pinyin. However, down the line, I started learning new words mainly on pinyin (general pronunciation) and it's relationship with the character. I could read the character and get the pinyin, but at that time, I couldn't speak yet, so I bypassed the tone, for I thought I'd learn that later. Now, when I can actually string sentences together, I realized I didn't focus on the tones. This is probably my biggest mistake thus far. From the START when learning new words, the TONE is PART of the WORD. Unless you speak it with the relating tone, you're effectively learning a different word. It might be a bit more effort, but words in Mandarin have an extra feature, learn the tones, 'cause it's part of the word. I wonder how this relates to linguistics? Is the tone part of the lexeme? Any sinolinguists wanna comment?\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Too much focus on vocabulary\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mistake might be a little paradoxical, but at first I focused way too much on getting a substantial vocab, that I neglected producing sentences. I was bent on recognizing more characters and more words, that by the time I had a substantial vocabulary, I was at a loss of how to string a simple sentence together. The best way to circumvent this is to learn the vocabulary within given examples. <a href=\\\"http://ichacha.net\\\">ChaCha</a> is great for this. Also try to make a sentences using your newly learned vocabulary. Not only does this make remembering it easier, it also places emphasis on getting those sentences out. When I was in Beijing last year for a summer school this exact problem arose. I was stuck with crude one word sentences, trying my best to explain. Coupled with mistake number one, those words we're horribly pronounced, and therefore I failed horrible at communicating. Words in context can sometimes convey the correct meaning even if the tone is wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Importance of Pinyin\\r\\n\\r\\nAt University there is a strong focus on characters. I also tried my best to avoid reading Pinyin, for it felt second-hand to the characters. I wanted to read this \\\"strange\\\" language how it's meant to be read. Little did I know, that reading pinyin, without characters, can also immensely help you're comprehension/listening. If you can read pinyin all strung together for without trying to look at characters, you're effectively \\\"listening\\\" to the language. This way, due to the homophonic nature of the language, you have to focus on the tones to get correct meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Diversifying my input\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the lack of motivation in the beginning, I merely did what was provided by our University. I still did very well academically, but comparing myself to other Mandarin learners, without formal education, I wondered how are they doing better than me? Time of course is an issue, but a lot of the instances diversifying your input can help a lot. At first I focused heavily on characters, now I'm watching Chinese series, reading more, listening to Chinese songs, doing translating and more. I can definitely feel my Mandarin improving substantially. If you're looking for some cool Chinese tunes, even with chords, check out this <a href=\\\"http://music.laowaichinese.net/mandarin\\\">LaoWai's own music!</a>\\r\\n\\r\\n5) Producing Mandarin\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the start I was focused on getting input. Yes, this might not be particularly bad, but in the end with the knowledge comes the production. Make the effort. Write some things, poems, lyrics, what happened in your day, talk to yourself in Chinese even. Just produce it. I remember making the effort in first year to ask my 老师 in Chinese, how to pronounce a character. I never made the effort again, of course until 3rd year where my speaking is a lot better. Get over the stumbling block. Make peace with the fact that you will get things wrong. Just let 'err rip!\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have any tips for beginners? Did you make some mistakes?

The\nmistakes I made, might not be mine particularly, but perhaps the way our course\nis structured. However, these mistakes can be applied to anyone starting to\nlearn Mandarin. These \"mistakes\" are not necessarily bad, but it's part of  my\ncurrent shortcomings in Mandarin that I still struggle with. Perhaps you can\nlearn from me and try to fill those gaps earlier on.\n\n 1. Tones are part of the word\n\nI grasped the tones really easy. I could pronounce separate words when I read\npinyin. However, down the line, I started learning new words mainly on pinyin\n(general pronunciation) and it's relationship with the character. I could read\nthe character and get the pinyin, but at that time, I couldn't speak yet, so I\nbypassed the tone, for I thought I'd learn that later. Now, when I can actually\nstring sentences together, I realized I didn't focus on the tones. This is\nprobably my biggest mistake thus far. From the START when learning new words,\nthe TONE is PART of the WORD. Unless you speak it with the relating tone, you're\neffectively learning a different word. It might be a bit more effort, but words\nin Mandarin have an extra feature, learn the tones, 'cause it's part of the\nword. I wonder how this relates to linguistics? Is the tone part of the lexeme?\nAny sinolinguists wanna comment?\n\n 2. Too much focus on vocabulary\n\nThis mistake might be a little paradoxical, but at first I focused way too much\non getting a substantial vocab, that I neglected producing sentences. I was bent\non recognizing more characters and more words, that by the time I had a\nsubstantial vocabulary, I was at a loss of how to string a simple sentence\ntogether. The best way to circumvent this is to learn the vocabulary within\ngiven examples. ChaCha [http://ichacha.net]  is great for this. Also try to make\na sentences using your newly learned vocabulary. Not only does this make\nremembering it easier, it also places emphasis on getting those sentences out.\nWhen I was in Beijing last year for a summer school this exact problem arose. I\nwas stuck with crude one word sentences, trying my best to explain. Coupled with\nmistake number one, those words we're horribly pronounced, and therefore I\nfailed horrible at communicating. Words in context can sometimes convey the\ncorrect meaning even if the tone is wrong.\n\n 3. Importance of Pinyin\n\nAt University there is a strong focus on characters. I also tried my best to\navoid reading Pinyin, for it felt second-hand to the characters. I wanted to\nread this \"strange\" language how it's meant to be read. Little did I know, that\nreading pinyin, without characters, can also immensely help you're\ncomprehension/listening. If you can read pinyin all strung together for without\ntrying to look at characters, you're effectively \"listening\" to the language.\nThis way, due to the homophonic nature of the language, you have to focus on the\ntones to get correct meaning.\n\n 4. Diversifying my input\n\nDue to the lack of motivation in the beginning, I merely did what was provided\nby our University. I still did very well academically, but comparing myself to\nother Mandarin learners, without formal education, I wondered how are they doing\nbetter than me? Time of course is an issue, but a lot of the instances\ndiversifying your input can help a lot. At first I focused heavily on\ncharacters, now I'm watching Chinese series, reading more, listening to Chinese\nsongs, doing translating and more. I can definitely feel my Mandarin improving\nsubstantially. If you're looking for some cool Chinese tunes, even with chords,\ncheck out this LaoWai's own music! [http://music.laowaichinese.net/mandarin]\n\n 5. Producing Mandarin\n\nAt the start I was focused on getting input. Yes, this might not be particularly\nbad, but in the end with the knowledge comes the production. Make the effort.\nWrite some things, poems, lyrics, what happened in your day, talk to yourself in\nChinese even. Just produce it. I remember making the effort in first year to ask\nmy 老师 in Chinese, how to pronounce a character. I never made the effort again,\nof course until 3rd year where my speaking is a lot better. Get over the\nstumbling block. Make peace with the fact that you will get things wrong. Just\nlet 'err rip!\n\nDo you have any tips for beginners? Did you make some mistakes?

However, this is obvious in my case, 'cause\nI have very few exposure to Chinese and can't immerse myself. I'm studying it at\nUniversity at about 5 hours a week of class, plus about another 5-10 hours of\nextra homework afterwards. I've studied for 2 and a half years, and I'm only now\nreaching mild conversational fluency, but I guess my reading is a lot better,\n'cause we focus on that a lot more.\n\nYou can perhaps blame my study method, however, I'm trying to console myself\nnow, that Chinese is indeed a difficult language, if you come from English. The\nrelative difference is immense and along with the characters, makes it double\nthe effort. This makes sense when you look at the US Foreign Service\ncategorizes\nChinese in.\n[http://thelinguist.blogs.com/how_to_learn_english_and/2010/07/how-long-should-it-take-to-learn-a-language.html] \n It is in group four along with Arabic, Korean and Japanese. All of them share a\nnon-roman alphabet.\n\nIn the comments posted on The Linguist\n[http://thelinguist.blogs.com/how_to_learn_english_and/2010/07/how-long-should-it-take-to-learn-a-language.html]\n, someone adds that it is impossible to learn Chinese within three months. I\nthink so too. The difference is just too big: the characters, the tones,\nthe pronunciation, getting to grips with amazingly simplistic grammar, most\nwords having only two syllables and extremely homophonic nature of the language.\nHowever, I think when you get the grips of all these you can roll will Chinese\nand get used to it very quickly. I'm reaching that point. Although I don't live\nin China, I'm starting to see signs of Mandarin progression.\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/05/you-know-youre-progressing-in-mandarin-when/] \n I'm actually getting to spontaneous speech. It's fun!\n\nAnother factor that one should take into account, when it comes to language\nlearning, is to consider, if you have learnt a second/foreign language before. I\nhighlight this, because Mandarin is my first foreign language. I grew up with\nAfrikaans and English natively, but Mandarin is my first new language from\nscratch. I've since started looking at other languages, such as Na'vi (from the\nAvatar Movie), Dutch (very very similar to Afrikaans), Spanish and a bit\nJapanese & Korean very briefly. It came to my realization, that I would be able\nto learn new languages much easier, because I now understand the processes that\nI've been - and still am - going through when it comes to acquiring a new\nlanguage. Thus, it gets easier with more experience. Thus, that is why Benny is\nhaving such success, having learnt 8+ languages.\n\nHowever, if you had to think, given full immersion and lots of effort, how long\nit would take to reach fluency Chinese? Sometimes I think learning Chinese first\nis a blessing and a curse. If you stick through it, you can say that you've\nlearned one of the hardest languages on the planet, however the curse: you need\nsome dedication and a lot of it... and as a bonus, as is happening with me, I\nfeel jaded in language learning.\n\nI'm learning Chinese people. It's probably the furthest away from English as you\ncan get. Besides those others in category 4: Arabic, Japanese and Korean, what\nwill I challenge myself with next? Anything else is going to be so boring. Where\nare my characters? What is this roman alphabet? Where are my tones? Where is the\nhistory?\n\nYeah, yeah, some other languages are also unique, but nothing makes me more\nproud now to say that I can actually speak, read, listen and write a bit of\nMandarin. 加油！加油！加油！","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-07-21T15:49:57.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2010-07-21T15:49:57.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-07-21T15:49:57.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b5998bf1e06cf00189b3bb3","uuid":"1dc7c691-91b9-42cd-8003-cfc46aa97547","title":"Laowai Chinese Music","slug":"laowai-chinese-music","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I've been on a mission lately to find some Chinese tunes to listen to.

My focus area will be Mandarin. So I'm going to see how\nI can improve some Mandarin learning techniques online. So keep your tabs on the\nsite. I'll probably need some testers in the future. There is also a chance that\nI might get into a MediaLab research department here on campus that focuses on\nresearching new tech and ways to improve new media. So, if I get into both,\nyou'll definitely see trying to develop some apps and sites that improve\nMandarin learning on the web. I might just change the way people learn Mandarin.\n;P","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-09-01T20:30:34.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2010-09-01T20:30:34.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-09-01T20:30:34.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b5998bf1e06cf00189b3bbb","uuid":"971150c8-2599-43ed-9f17-9c6e74792d0b","title":"The Weirdest (and most beautiful) Chinese Idiom I've Seen","slug":"the-weirdest-and-most-beautiful-chinese-idiom-ive-seen","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Recently for my Mandarin homework I came across an idiom that baffled me on its origin.

Like being offered to review\npremium services free of charge. Not only, do I have an interest in language\nlearning, but I'm very interested in how hypermedia and new media can be used to\naid the language learning process.\n\nThat's basically what I'm aiming to study next year as well: an MPhil in\nHypermedia for Language Learning. L-Lingo [http://l-lingo.com]  is one of those\nsites that utilize various media within a web context.\n\nFirst Impressions\n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837600/llingo_obyzeb.jpg]\nThe site fills a great niche, which is definitely up my alley, by providing\nlearning for Asian languages. From Chinese to Thai. It's homepage looks great\nand draws you in. Some minor grievances: not being able to login from the\nhomepage and clicking on a language brings you to another page and not straight\nto content.\n\nAiding the Learner\n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837599/llingokaren_uhc4aw.jpg]\nL-Lingo uses a nice in your browser interface to bring you the content. It is\nalso presented in 4 languages. Upon entering the content you are greeted with a\npop-up, letting you pick your settings, such as phonetic script or standard\nscript and then providing you with tutorials. Although the tutorials are useful,\nI feel that a program should be created in such a way that it can be used\nwithout even using tutorials. It should be obvious from the get go.\n\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837598/buttons_dit2br.jpg]\n\nThat is where L-Lingo fails a bit. Maybe, I'm not \"getting\" everything as\nobvious, but there are big questions, but it just doesn't explain enough of why\nthings happen the way they do, and what goes on. If I click on the first lesson\nand enter the \"training mode\"  I am bombarded with pictures and sound and text.\nIt is overwhelming. Furthermore, when it ends there is no clear indication on\nwhat is happening next. Should you do something? I don't understand. I'm\nclicking things, but it's just not clear.\n\nEven then, when going to the \"next section\" is still doesn't tell you what is\ngoing on. Thus, L-Lingo suffers a bit in the user interface department.\n\nThe Content\n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837598/hengaoxing_z444c3.jpg]\nL-Lingo's content is presented in an interesting manner. They use pictures and\nsound in all posts and the quality is good. They also use, as shown above,\ninteresting diagrams to support the picture itself to aid understanding. This\nonce again, interesting in its own way, lacks proper explanation. Later I felt\nthat I'm learning how respond to those symbols and not the pictures themselves.\n\nL-Lingo, however, cover a wide range of functional helpful content, from getting\nnumbers right to tasks such as \"At the Airport\" and so on. Thus, the content\nthey provide are relevant, which is a big plus. However, their content is not\npresented in an entirely satisfactory way.\n\nThey aim more on learning phrases as a whole, than separate words and functions\nof linguistics units. I'm an intermediate Mandarin speaker, thus the first\nlessons were obvious for me, however I thought how would a new learner of the\nlanguage learn this? So I quickly tried some other languages such as Japanese\nand Korean, which I have very little knowledge of. Yes, I could complete the\nquizzes, but I had no idea what I was learning other than just the rote\nrepetition of whole phrases.\n\nAlso for an intermediate learner of Mandarin, the starting content was boring\nand there was no indication on the difficulty, so I could skip to my level.\nHowever, the gradient it took was a nice gradual increase in complexity. This\nbeing said, the learning process just isn't completely captivating. After trying\nthe Japanese, I felt the same kind of lack of motivation to work through the\ncontent. This, could possibly be because of the lack of guidance, but I felt\nthat the process, although presented in a nice way (pictures + sound), was still\nslow and slightly boring.\n\nAn interesting addition is the ability to print and download the content which\nexplains the content a bit better, but it's not entirely there yet.\n\nConclusion\nL-Lingo has an interesting approach and one that uses multimedia really well.\nHowever, there are some things that are lacking in its approach. Maybe I'm just\nreally impatient, but I felt frustrated by the program and its deliverance of\nthe content. It seems like a new website, thus if can remedy the way it guides\nthe user and add some more concrete explanations to the content, then L-Lingo\ncould be great, especially as a need for Asian languages.\n\nPoint Summary\n * Asian Languages!\n * Quality Multimedia\n * Web-based Interactive Program\n * Relevant Content\n\n+/- Quizzes feel rewarding, but at the same time I'm not even sure if I know\nwhat I am learning. Just that I could connect one sound byte to a picture.\n\n * User Interface confusing\n * Content not explained\n\nGiveaway\nL-Lingo is letting me give away 5 Premium Licences to their website that lasts\nfor 3 Months. You can choose any language of the 9. The first 5 people to either\nemail me (confusedlaowai@gmail.com) or comment below will get the service.\nEDIT: 1 spot still left.

At first my comments were strong, but never personal or attacking. Randy interpreted this an attack. I got frustrated and did post a comment confronting him on his blatant disregard for people's opinions and his way of handling the comments. This got out of hand. However, in my final comment I aimed to explain exactly what I mean in the most sincerest way possible. Usually I'm not a person for a pissing contest, but this post is not about that. This post is because this comment got deleted and I feel I spent way too much effort on it to let it just disappear; I did quite a bit of research on how vocabulary is acquired in Second Language Acquisition. Comments added for context:\\r\\n\\r\\nHey Randy,\\r\\n\\r\\nso where do I start? Oh yeah, I was raised bilingually in Afrikaans and English and I've studied Mandarin for three years at University. I also have a degree in General Linguistics. So, technically yes, I'm not fluent (per my definition) in a foreign language. However, please don't use my lack of fluency in a foreign language as an argument against my opinion on flashcards, 'cause I feel this might be the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, let me begin. I hope you give me my time of day to \\\"[challenge] the assumptions and beliefs of traditional methods\\\" [context note: quote from Randy's post]. Let me break this down. First part of my argument (feels like I'm writing an essay here) is that the translation step is not a detrimental step in language learning. My basis for my argument comes from my Linguistic studies, my opinion on vocabulary in Second Language Acquisition and research I have done by looking up how other polyglots study vocab and how the lexicon works in the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, my linguistics studies taught me that one's First Language, like I've said earlier, forms the basis for one's second language acquisition. You can look this up. This is a well researched topic among SLA linguists. Therefore, SLA almost always includes the translation step [context note: this means to refer back to first language vocabulary as a basis for you second language vocabulary]. Thus, in my opinion, this would not be a detrimental step, but a part of any healthy language learning method. HOWEVER, I must add that, the translation step among some people is very quick and simple. Other people however, as you pointed out by the Italian learner [context note: the learner had trouble with speaking Italian because after three years he still had trouble speaking because he kept thinking in his first language], gets stuck in the translation step. This is not something that is induced by focus on the translation step, but rather the learner themselves not being able to transgress the translation step, or the interlanguage. This is also sometimes marked by the term fossilization, by where the SLA grammar/knowledge no longer develops to due strong interference from the first language, or lack of progress on L2.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy next point, comes from research I have done by asking around and searching a bit on the web on how other polyglots learn vocabulary and if the translation step is at all bad. Coincidentally it led to a forum/site which I remember signing up to in the beginning of this year. One of the first threads I stumble upon is this one - Is translation bad? - <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/bWlPVp\\\">http://bit.ly/bWlPVp</a> - it details discussion among polyglots on the validity of translating into one's first language. I quote Iversen, a speaker of 12 languages: \\\"the function of using a translation is that a wellknown word or expression in your own language carries a whole lot of associations with it. These will make it easier both to remember and to apply the foreign word, and by having a translation by a confirmed source you avoid the risk pointed out by Cainntear, namely that you make wrong guesses about the meaning because the context can be interpreted in several ways. Then you can always add more meanings and caveats later. \\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is very much in tune with my idea of the translation step and the theories set out by linguists in using your first language as resource for your SLA. A word is merely a label for a concept. Using a previously known label for a concept merely aids in transferring the already established concept onto a different label.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is backed by an article I read on how the lexicon works with SLA - <a href=\\\"http://bit.ly/b4dFEu\\\">http://bit.ly/b4dFEu</a> - heads up it gets very technical! If you want to skip a bit, read the section 3.1 on \\\"Psycholinguistic research on the relationship between L1 and L2 word forms and meaning\\\". But a brief introduction: A word consists of two parts: lemma and lexeme. Lemma = the concept/meaning/semantic message it conveys and the lexeme is the form, literally how it looks or how your hear it. These parts can all be learned separately, thus a word is not a single \\\"slot\\\" but rather made up of parts. The article basically states, that \\\"in early and later bilinguals, L1 and L2 forms clearly have a significant influence on one another. Lemmas in the form of conceptual features, conflation patterns, and projection of clause structure seems to rely heavily but not exclusively on the L1 early in development for adult SLA, but need not fossilize into L1 transferred patterns.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, this conforms with my idea. Note the \\\"not exclusively on L1\\\" part as some research has been found that conceptualization of L2 concepts is possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo how does all this evidence tie in flashcards? Flashcards are there to help you build up your vocabulary and is in no way detrimental to your language acquisition, because of the translation step. The only time the translation step becomes a problem is when it forms a bad habit. Also, flashcards, which I can agree with forms part of passive vocabulary at first and only when one starts using them form part of active vocabulary. Furthermore, I would like to add that in languages like Chinese, where the pronunciation can not be inferred by the script, using flashcards is extremely helpful as it learns you how to pronounce a character, which is completely arbitrary. Only when one first learn the pronunciation can one start working it into context and other uses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother point I'd like to raise is that, with Chinese characters, I have found that learning words in context, it has been almost counter-productive, as I later discovered that I don't learn characters on their own, but the way they are formed with other characters. Thus sometimes when presented with a single character (which has meaning) I have no idea how to pronounce it or what it means, but only when I see it in context do I remember it. This happens often in Chinese. I get extremely frustrated when I look at signs and I know a character looks familiar, but after checking it up, realise it was the second character of another word I glanced over everytime. This could have been solved by focusing more on one-to-one word meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I'd like to end this extremely post in saying that I do not accuse your method as wrong. This is the basis of language learning. One has to find one's own method. If it works you, that's good, by all means go for it. Furthermore, language learning is not a race, or has a homogeneous goal. Some people are content is merely reading and writing a language, where others love to speak it, but hardly touch the writing etc etc. In conclusion, this post is here to help you challenge your belief that the translation step is a detrimental part to language learning. Flashcards can be improved, but their usefulness cannot be disputed. I hope I provided enough evidence for my convictions and I hope this finds you in good taste. If you'd like to discuss this further, I'm eager to hear replies and I would gladly do more research.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheers,\\r\\nNielDLR \\r\\n\\r\\nThat was the comment. I would like to add a bit more. With Chinese, I have found that time and time again that technically we learn two things when we look at a character. The pronunciation and the meaning. That's one of the big reasons why it takes a bit longer to learn Chinese. We learn two \\\"labels\\\"/lexemes for the same lemma when we learn Chinese characters. This sometimes even manifests in a strange phenomenon, where I often read Chinese on my first parsing merely as a test if I can pronounce all the characters, then I go back over to make sure I understand the sentence perfectly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for reading this long post, but I hope you learned something in the process. Did I miss something really obvious?

Thus, in my opinion, this would not be a detrimental step, but a part of any healthy language learning method. HOWEVER, I must add that, the translation step among some people is very quick and simple. Other people however, as you pointed out by the Italian learner [context note: the learner had trouble with speaking Italian because after three years he still had trouble speaking because he kept thinking in his first language], gets stuck in the translation step. This is not something that is induced by focus on the translation step, but rather the learner themselves not being able to transgress the translation step, or the interlanguage. This is also sometimes marked by the term fossilization, by where the SLA grammar/knowledge no longer develops to due strong interference from the first language, or lack of progress on L2.</p>\n<p>My next point, comes from research I have done by asking around and searching a bit on the web on how other polyglots learn vocabulary and if the translation step is at all bad. Coincidentally it led to a forum/site which I remember signing up to in the beginning of this year. One of the first threads I stumble upon is this one - Is translation bad? - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/bWlPVp\">http://bit.ly/bWlPVp</a> - it details discussion among polyglots on the validity of translating into one's first language. I quote Iversen, a speaker of 12 languages: &quot;the function of using a translation is that a wellknown word or expression in your own language carries a whole lot of associations with it. These will make it easier both to remember and to apply the foreign word, and by having a translation by a confirmed source you avoid the risk pointed out by Cainntear, namely that you make wrong guesses about the meaning because the context can be interpreted in several ways. Then you can always add more meanings and caveats later. &quot;</p>\n<p>This is very much in tune with my idea of the translation step and the theories set out by linguists in using your first language as resource for your SLA. A word is merely a label for a concept. Using a previously known label for a concept merely aids in transferring the already established concept onto a different label.</p>\n<p>This is backed by an article I read on how the lexicon works with SLA - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/b4dFEu\">http://bit.ly/b4dFEu</a> - heads up it gets very technical! If you want to skip a bit, read the section 3.1 on &quot;Psycholinguistic research on the relationship between L1 and L2 word forms and meaning&quot;. But a brief introduction: A word consists of two parts: lemma and lexeme. Lemma = the concept/meaning/semantic message it conveys and the lexeme is the form, literally how it looks or how your hear it. These parts can all be learned separately, thus a word is not a single &quot;slot&quot; but rather made up of parts. The article basically states, that &quot;in early and later bilinguals, L1 and L2 forms clearly have a significant influence on one another. Lemmas in the form of conceptual features, conflation patterns, and projection of clause structure seems to rely heavily but not exclusively on the L1 early in development for adult SLA, but need not fossilize into L1 transferred patterns.&quot;</p>\n<p>Once again, this conforms with my idea. Note the &quot;not exclusively on L1&quot; part as some research has been found that conceptualization of L2 concepts is possible.</p>\n<p>So how does all this evidence tie in flashcards? Flashcards are there to help you build up your vocabulary and is in no way detrimental to your language acquisition, because of the translation step. The only time the translation step becomes a problem is when it forms a bad habit. Also, flashcards, which I can agree with forms part of passive vocabulary at first and only when one starts using them form part of active vocabulary. Furthermore, I would like to add that in languages like Chinese, where the pronunciation can not be inferred by the script, using flashcards is extremely helpful as it learns you how to pronounce a character, which is completely arbitrary. Only when one first learn the pronunciation can one start working it into context and other uses.</p>\n<p>Another point I'd like to raise is that, with Chinese characters, I have found that learning words in context, it has been almost counter-productive, as I later discovered that I don't learn characters on their own, but the way they are formed with other characters. Thus sometimes when presented with a single character (which has meaning) I have no idea how to pronounce it or what it means, but only when I see it in context do I remember it. This happens often in Chinese. I get extremely frustrated when I look at signs and I know a character looks familiar, but after checking it up, realise it was the second character of another word I glanced over everytime. This could have been solved by focusing more on one-to-one word meanings.</p>\n<p>However, I'd like to end this extremely post in saying that I do not accuse your method as wrong. This is the basis of language learning. One has to find one's own method. If it works you, that's good, by all means go for it. Furthermore, language learning is not a race, or has a homogeneous goal. Some people are content is merely reading and writing a language, where others love to speak it, but hardly touch the writing etc etc. In conclusion, this post is here to help you challenge your belief that the translation step is a detrimental part to language learning. Flashcards can be improved, but their usefulness cannot be disputed. I hope I provided enough evidence for my convictions and I hope this finds you in good taste. If you'd like to discuss this further, I'm eager to hear replies and I would gladly do more research.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nNielDLR</p>\n<p>That was the comment. I would like to add a bit more. With Chinese, I have found that time and time again that technically we learn two things when we look at a character. The pronunciation and the meaning. That's one of the big reasons why it takes a bit longer to learn Chinese. We learn two &quot;labels&quot;/lexemes for the same lemma when we learn Chinese characters. This sometimes even manifests in a strange phenomenon, where I often read Chinese on my first parsing merely as a test if I can pronounce all the characters, then I go back over to make sure I understand the sentence perfectly.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this long post, but I hope you learned something in the process.

I\nwas subsequently banned from the site, because of my strong ideas on flashcards.\nRandy firmly believed that flashcards are detrimental to language learning. I\nthought differently. At first my comments were strong, but never personal or\nattacking. Randy interpreted this an attack. I got frustrated and did post a\ncomment confronting him on his blatant disregard for people's opinions and his\nway of handling the comments. This got out of hand. However, in my final comment\nI aimed to explain exactly what I mean in the most sincerest way possible.\nUsually I'm not a person for a pissing contest, but this post is not about that.\nThis post is because this comment got deleted and I feel I spent way too much\neffort on it to let it just disappear; I did quite a bit of research on how\nvocabulary is acquired in Second Language Acquisition. Comments added for\ncontext:\n\nHey Randy,\n\nso where do I start? Oh yeah, I was raised bilingually in Afrikaans and English\nand I've studied Mandarin for three years at University. I also have a degree in\nGeneral Linguistics. So, technically yes, I'm not fluent (per my definition) in\na foreign language. However, please don't use my lack of fluency in a foreign\nlanguage as an argument against my opinion on flashcards, 'cause I feel this\nmight be the issue.\n\nAlas, let me begin. I hope you give me my time of day to \"[challenge] the\nassumptions and beliefs of traditional methods\" [context note: quote from\nRandy's post]. Let me break this down. First part of my argument (feels like I'm\nwriting an essay here) is that the translation step is not a detrimental step in\nlanguage learning. My basis for my argument comes from my Linguistic studies, my\nopinion on vocabulary in Second Language Acquisition and research I have done by\nlooking up how other polyglots study vocab and how the lexicon works in the\nbrain.\n\nFirstly, my linguistics studies taught me that one's First Language, like I've\nsaid earlier, forms the basis for one's second language acquisition. You can\nlook this up. This is a well researched topic among SLA linguists. Therefore,\nSLA almost always includes the translation step [context note: this means to\nrefer back to first language vocabulary as a basis for you second language\nvocabulary]. Thus, in my opinion, this would not be a detrimental step, but a\npart of any healthy language learning method.

I <a href=\\\"http://pangbianr.com/order-the-la-loupe-cd/\\\">ordered their CD</a> some time ago and have been listening to it non-stop! Cleverly written acoustic folk vibes... but in Chinese. The lyrics are easy to understand and very relate-able. For instance, in the song Pengyou, they sing 朋友真的不想你走, among many other excellent lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I asked them a few them a few questions on music, laowai and learning Chinese. Maia answered the questions:\\r\\n<h4>1) Why did you guys start learning Chinese, and how long has it been now?</h4><br><br>\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan started learning Chinese in High School in NYC. I started learning Chinese my first year at Oberlin College in Ohio. I had studied Spanish and Italian in High School, and really enjoy learning languages, but wanted to try something new. I had been interested in Asia for a while so I was deciding between Japanese and Chinese. I basically chose Chinese on a whim, and ended up sticking with it for all four years of college.\\r\\n<h4>2) What are your experiences learning Chinese? Was it a battle, or was the motivation always high?</h4><br><br>\\r\\nThe first two years of taking Chinese were extremely difficult for me. I almost decided not to take it again my second year since I found it so challenging and time-consuming. I had lost sight of why I was even taking it (and at that point majoring in East Asian Studies.) Not until I studied abroad in Yunnan the Fall of my Junior year (the first time I traveled in China) did I realize that all of the effort I put into the language wasn't in vain. After learning more about Chinese culture, society, and what it's like to actually live in China I re-gained motivation for committing myself to learning the language. The following summer, I attended an intensive Chinese language program in Beijing, which was when the language finally clicked for me.\\r\\n<h4>3) How did La Loupe form, and why did you guys decide to sing/write in Chinese?</h4><br><br>\\r\\nJordan and I became close friends when attending Oberlin College together. We also both grew up in New York. The spring after Jordan and I both studied abroad in China, we lived together in a room at College. We had been playing music together, mostly fooling around with some English songs Jordan wrote. I wrote a song in Chinese for fun, \\\"Ni Shi Shei?\\\" and played it for Jordan. He thought it was pretty cool, so he started writing songs in Chinese as well, and then we started writing the songs together. It all took off from there. By the end of the semester, we had written over 10 songs, all in Chinese.\\r\\n<h4>4) How do you guys go about writing lyrics? Is there a marked difference in writing English songs versus Chinese songs?</h4><br><br>\\r\\nWhen we first started off, our songs were written completely collaboratively, especially lyrically. Recently, though, usually Jordan or I will write a song on our own, and the other will add guitar parts or vocal harmonies. We both find that writing songs in Chinese is easier, for it allows for more freedom and depth of expression. For example, one Chinese character can convey the same meaning that one whole sentence in English does. Each character holds more weight and layers of meaning, which gives the listener a more enhanced field for interpretation. Also, writing in Chinese as opposed to English makes me feel less self-conscious, which makes me feel more comfortable to be very direct in my lyrics. I find that this is often the nature of speaking a second language.\\r\\n<h4>5) What was the response so far to La Loupe, especially in China? How do the Chinese experience your music?</h4><br><br>\\r\\nWe were very excited to play our first show in China, since it was the first time that we played to an audience that could understand our lyrics (as opposed to shows at Oberlin where only our Chinese language classmates got our jokes and would explain to others what we were singing about.) Chinese people in Beijing were extremely receptive to our songs and the fact that we're Americans singing in Chinese. Our lyrics especially resonated with the Chinese audience. After most shows, Chinese people would come up to us to explain how much our lyrics meant to them, since we cover topics that most Chinese singers don't.\\r\\n<h4>6) Do you guys think more laowai should start writing Chinese songs, and has writing Chinese songs improved your Chinese?</h4><br><br>\\r\\nSure, we'd encourage other foreigners to start writing Chinese songs, it's a good way to practice your Chinese! Yet, we would discourage people from writing songs in Chinese as a sort of schtick, as in just for the sake that it's in Chinese rather than actually adding a new dimension/something positive to the songs.\\r\\n<h4>7) What is the future for La Loupe? Will you guys continue to write songs in Chinese?</h4><br><br>\\r\\nLast summer was an important time for us. We self-released our first full-length studio album, which we spent the spring/summer recording in Beijing at The Sweet Factory. We also filmed our first music video! Right now, since I'm living in Taiwan and Jordan is still in mainland China, we're taking a break playing live. But, we're still writing songs and thinking about future music videos and projects. I'm sure you'll see La Loupe back together again in the near future!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can stream <a href=\\\"http://pangbianr.com/la-loupe-record-release/\\\">four of their songs here</a>.

He thought it was pretty cool, so he started writing songs in Chinese as well, and then we started writing the songs together. It all took off from there.

For example, one Chinese character can convey the same meaning that one whole sentence in English does. Each character holds more weight and layers of meaning, which gives the listener a more enhanced field for interpretation.

I ordered\ntheir CD [http://pangbianr.com/order-the-la-loupe-cd/]  some time ago and have\nbeen listening to it non-stop! Cleverly written acoustic folk vibes... but in\nChinese. The lyrics are easy to understand and very relate-able. For instance,\nin the song Pengyou, they sing 朋友真的不想你走, among many other excellent lines.So, I\nasked them a few them a few questions on music, laowai and learning Chinese.\nMaia answered the questions:\n\n1) Why did you guys start learning Chinese, and how long has it been now?\n\n\nJordan started learning Chinese in High School in NYC. I started learning\nChinese my first year at Oberlin College in Ohio. I had studied Spanish and\nItalian in High School, and really enjoy learning languages, but wanted to try\nsomething new. I had been interested in Asia for a while so I was deciding\nbetween Japanese and Chinese. I basically chose Chinese on a whim, and ended up\nsticking with it for all four years of college.\n\n2) What are your experiences learning Chinese? Was it a battle, or was the\nmotivation always high?\n\n\nThe first two years of taking Chinese were extremely difficult for me. I almost\ndecided not to take it again my second year since I found it so challenging and\ntime-consuming. I had lost sight of why I was even taking it (and at that point\nmajoring in East Asian Studies.) Not until I studied abroad in Yunnan the Fall\nof my Junior year (the first time I traveled in China) did I realize that all of\nthe effort I put into the language wasn't in vain.

My Chinese was a bit bad back then, but\npart of the competition included a \"culture\" section. You could do anything\nChinese really. Sing a song, say a poem, tell a story, do calligraphy or dancing\nwhatever. I decided early on I'd sing a song.\n\nI didn't know any Chinese songs back then, so I Googled quite a lot to find a\nsuitable song. I was looking for a nice acoustic tune so that I could play it on\nguitar. I then found 崔健's 花房姑娘. Translated as Greenhouse Girl, I immediately\nfell in love with this song. I got the tabs for the song and furiously went to\nlearning it.\n\nIt took me quite some time to get the lyrics memorized, which I did completely\nwrong by the way. I learned the syllables and not what the lyrics actually\nmeant. Which meant that I got extremely frustrated in learning the song.\nNevertheless I managed to learn most of the lines before the competition. Along\nwith my guitar I did a solid performance. Although my speech and test (other\nparts of the competition) didn't go so well, I didn't win anything. But that is\nfine with me, I had a wonderful time and learned a brilliant song.\n\nLittle did I know that a year later my girlfriend would come to me saying that\nthey are learning a song in Chinese (she just finished her first year in\nChinese, same University). I was intrigued and she said something about a girl\nand flowers. My instincts proved right when I looked at the lyrics. This song\nhas now become a song that embodies my Chinese learning experience and something\nthat I share with my girlfriend. Incidentally her Chinese name is 白花 and her\nreal life name is Saffron.

The other thing is, if someone uses obscure words, how does one retain the new meaning, if one is not presented with the character? If the frequency is too low, then the word would struggle to be retained in its spoken form. Thus, an interesting distinction is drawn again between Chinese in writing and Chinese in spoken form.

These\ncharacters I did research on however, have the same pronunciations as average\nwords or words with higher frequency.\n\n爠 for instance, pronounced qú, shares its meaning with 50 different similar\nsounding words\n[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdqman=q%C3%BA&cdrbst=0&cdmantmce=1]\n. The same for 潧 -zhēn - which has 72 similar sounding words\n[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdqman=zh%C4%93n&cdrbst=0&cdmantmce=1]\n. Thus, listening becomes a hard task when has to take into account obscure\nwords. The context I reckon would be very very important. The character itself\nwould be the defining meaning negotiator. The other thing is, if someone uses\nobscure words, how does one retain the new meaning, if one is not presented with\nthe character? If the frequency is too low, then the word would struggle to be\nretained in its spoken form. Thus, an interesting distinction is drawn again\nbetween Chinese in writing and Chinese in spoken form. There's no way I'd\nremember 潧, when listening there are words like 真 to listen to, but if the\nmeaning is provided to me, I'd have to associate it with a new \"word unit\", but\nthe form in terms of the sound is too average for it to be unique. For me,\nlearning Chinese, you absolutely have to learn to read it as well to truly\nunderstand the language.\n\nLeave your thoughts!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2011-03-07T16:26:43.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-08-24T14:18:55.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2011-03-07T16:26:43.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b5998bf1e06cf00189b3bcc","uuid":"d3b5632a-f27b-4598-b376-bf97454c7f09","title":"The most spontaneous Chinese I've spoken was to a Laowai","slug":"the-most-spontaneous-chinese-ive-spoken-was-to-a-laowai","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I don't know how to feel about it.

Three topics were\ncovered: one was how people actually perceive music (the brain process\nliterally) and how dissonance can cause the brain to react strangely (read: Igor\nStravinsky's Rite of Spring), a guy who managed to emulate classical composers\nby taking all the compositions and computing likely compositions and then\nfinally the one that is most interesting, tonal languages and its relations to\nperfect pitch.\n\nI recommend to the whole podcast, 'cause it is insanely fascinating, but if you\ndon't have the time here's the one on Mandarin and pitch\n[http://www.radiolab.org/2007/sep/24/behaves-so-strangely/]. Diana Deutsch, a\nProfessor in Psychology of music, found that tonal language learners who have it\nas their first language, are more likely to develop perfect pitch. For those not\nfamiliar with the term it \"is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a\ngiven musical note without the benefit of an external reference\" [1]\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch].\n\nThe Findings\nShe noticed that words often spoken at different times and different situations,\nhad a very small variance in pitch difference. Thus their absolute pitch\ntemplates stayed the same. It was also found that comparing American and Chinese\nstudents, that Chinese students, even those that did not take music, far\noutperformed the American children in pitch exercises.The findings of the  former experiment's paper\n[http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm]  were: \"Speakers of\nVietnamese and Mandarin possess an extraordinarily precise form of absolute\npitch, which is reflected in their enunciation of words. Since all except one of\nthe subjects in the study had received little or no musical training, we\nconclude that this ability resulted from their early acquisition of tone\nlanguage, so that they had learned to associate pitches with meaningful words\nvery early in life.\"\n\nLanguage Learners, Music and Tonal Languages\nThis is extremely fascinating. But what does really mean for language learners?\nI wonder how people with musical backgrounds and those lucky enough to have been\nborn with perfect pitch adapt to tonal languages, in this case Mandarin. In my\nown experience, I grasped tones really easily and could replicate them from very\nearly on. In my spare time I listen to a lot of music, I go to at least one\ngig/concert/club in a week and produce my own music too. Music is one of my\npassions. My musical theory sucks though. So I can't \"talk\" music. I just know\nand \"feel\" it, however hippy that sounds.I'd like to think that it helped me in\ngrasp tones easier. The only thing that I have trouble with and still have is\nmaking the connection between different tones as a meaning difference. I can\nhear they sound different, but I still have to realize they are different words.\n\nAre you battling with tones? Did you get them easy? Do you like music?\nProduce/compose music? Let me know! And please do yourself a favour and listen\nto that podcast.

I would put myself into where I can understand quite a\nfew sentences if spoken slowly, but native-like speed and functional elements I\nstill struggle with. Furthermore, when watching a TV series I still rely a lot\non the subtitles to get the full meaning.\n\nWhere would you put yourself?

What Chinese loses in morphological\ncomplexity and tense, it gains in sentence structure, vocabulary and aspect. \nThe 过，着 and 了's of Chinese makes for a tough concept.Furthermore, the difference\nbetween English and Chinese grammar, not only makes Chinese seem simplistic, but\nwhat it really does is dumbing down the Chinese grammar, because it allows us to\nthink, that we don't need to apply effort in understanding it's grammar.\n\nMy Experience\nNow, I was told this when I started learning Chinese: the grammar is easy.\nHowever, this was the first time I started learning a new language. I fumbled a\nlot at first, like people do of course, but I was under the impression that the\ngrammar was easy. Why is this taking so much time to understand? Why am I so\nunsure of my sentence structure?  Why did I want to add extra things from\nEnglish that need be said in Chinese: the prepositions for example.This is\nbecause, grammar is not absolute.\n\nI was influenced by English thinking AND I expected something easy.\n\nPossible solution?\nNow in retrospect, I can say, Chinese grammar is fairly easy, because I have a\ngrasp of it to some extent. But at the start, I had a lot of difficulty. The\nsimplistic grammar was the hurdle. I wanted to make it more complex.  I wanted\nto add extra words.I remember one of my first orals in my Chinese 1st year\nclass, I wrote so many 和's because I thought it implied the same \"and\" in\nEnglish as a conjunction. For example saying, \"Today I went to the shop and then\nI bought a beer\". The Chinese equivalent would be, \"今天我去了商店买到一瓶啤酒\" and if you\nreally want to add a conjunction you can add 然后, but it's not really necessary.\n\nAre you guys catching my drift here?\n\nIn a way, that's why I like Chinese-Ordered English\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/05/chinese-ordered-english/]  as an initial wake\nup call to the grammar of Chinese. LOOK! It is different! Simplistic yes, but\nrealize this. Realize the simplicity. Realize that Chinese grammar is different\nfrom English. Don't get stuck in the trap that simplicity = easy.\n\nOddly enough, when you get that Chinese grammar is different, it will become\neasy.\n\nWhat's your opinion on Chinese grammar? Any experiences to share?

I thought I'd be able to talk... at least a bit. Come on! But alas my use of Chinese was limited to spotting characters and using single words to communicate. A phrasebook could have had a better conversation than I did. So this time around I set myself with little expectations and a desire to use every opportunity to learn. Boy, was I surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could actually talk! It was like a validation of my years of learning Chinese. Needless to say, at times it was difficult and there were some gaps in my vocabulary, but I just told myself, now or never. Even if I don't understand everything clearly, just roll with it. Get those pragmatic language skills working to make up for the lack of experience in speaking. I have to admit, one massive help was my <a href=\\\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.embermitre.hanping.app.pro\\\">Hanping Chinese Dictionary app</a>.\\r\\n<h2>Some stories</h2>\\r\\nIn Shanghai, most of my time was spent on sightseeing and being a tourist, but I remember the first morning walking to a metro station, stopping by a small cafe for a bottle of water. Besides checking in and being exhausted from flying, this was my first test of Chinese. Two minutes later I had a water in my hand, beaming, because I did all that just in Chinese. Yes. Yes. For most of the readers, this seems like non-point. An average every day occurrence. But for me, who don't have these opportunities, this was the start of big confidence booster and a very interesting journey with Chinese.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater in the Hostel I sat and chilled in the lounge and heard one of the owners playing a beautiful Chinese song on guitar. I immediately told him it sounded great and asked the name of the song. He showed me his guitar tab book with the name. Just I was about to write it down, he said he had it on his phone. He sent it to me via bluetooth. The song's name was called 陌生人, which means stranger. I noticed 陌生人 three more times written on TV and across China. Now I'll never forget this word. Immersion is so easy! :)\\r\\n<h2>Booking Hotels &amp; Renting Apartments</h2>\\r\\nI never spoke English to Chinese people. If I couldn't say what I wanted, I forced myself to try and explain. If my vocabulary failed me. I quickly pulled out my dictionary app. In Xiamen, I did not even have the opportunity to switch over to English, because frankly, it is far less pervasive than in Shanghai. I remember landing in Xiamen, heading straight to a hotel to book a room for two nights. To my surprise (I don't even know why? I should have expected this), they couldn't talk ANY English. I booked my room for two nights, I even went to check out the room before taking it, all in Chinese. I did however stumble a bit when they told about the free breakfast. They kept saying times, but I had no idea why. After some negotiation, I realized it was breakfast. My girlfriend somehow helped me on this too, 'cause they said the breakfast was “送”, but I haven't encountered this before. She said it was free. Like complimentary in a sense. She was right. In shops I often saw this: “买一送一” which means, buy one get one free!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after that I went in search for an apartment building to rent a short-term apartment. It was cheaper and more convenient (girlfriend could sleep over, had a fridge and a better view!). I did some research before I went to Xiamen and knew where to look. I found the offices, but I had no idea what to expect. I entered the lobby of the building asking the security personnel sitting behind the frontdesk how to get to the offices. They looked at me funny. I thought my Chinese was clear. After some talking and stumbling, I realized the frontdesk WAS the office. Had a chuckle. But I couldn't manage to book a room just yet, because it was too late in the day. I came back the morning to book a room. Then it hit me: I totally just rented an apartment all in Chinese. At first they couldn't understand why I would want to rent an apartment (guess they don't get many foreigners there), but I signed the contract and paid my deposit and got the key. Yay!\\r\\n\\r\\nI did read the contract (only in Chinese) first thing I put down my bags though. Just to make sure I didn't get screwed... even if I was, I already signed, but at least I could prepare myself.\\r\\n<h2>A Visit to the Barber</h2>\\r\\nA few days later my girlfriend and some of her classmates decided to go for a haircut, Chinese style. I tagged along. In the end I got a haircut in typical androgynous Chinese boy band style. However, before we went I tried to look up words to use. Some like catalogue (编目) for example. I'd have no chance to explain the intricacies of a haircut and specialized vocab, but pictures always help. My girlfriend opted for big cut with straightening and everything. My cut was quick, but I ended chilling with the hairdressers, about 10 guys while my girlfriend got her cut. Throughout that time, about two hours, Chinese was spoken, from politics to clubs in Xiamen to even learning the hairdresser some English words. I laughed and joked around with them. I truly felt like being on top the conversations most of the time. Once again, my dictionary app worked overtime!\\r\\n<h2>The Flight Home</h2>\\r\\nOne last story.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne the way back from Shanghai to South Africa. I took the metro to Pudong Airport. An old man and what looked like her daughter sat across from me on the train most of the way. I stopped over in Kuala Lumpur for a few hours. When I boarded the plane from KL to Cape Town, lo and behold, I sat next to them on the plane. The odds of course astonishing. They also realized it and I could see they recognized me too.

I thought I'd be able to talk... at least a bit. Come on! But alas my use of Chinese was limited to spotting characters and using single words to communicate. A phrasebook could have had a better conversation than I did. So this time around I set myself with little expectations and a desire to use every opportunity to learn.

I have to admit, one massive help was my <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.embermitre.hanping.app.pro\">Hanping Chinese Dictionary app</a>.</p>\n<h2>Some stories</h2>\nIn Shanghai, most of my time was spent on sightseeing and being a tourist, but I remember the first morning walking to a metro station, stopping by a small cafe for a bottle of water. Besides checking in and being exhausted from flying, this was my first test of Chinese. Two minutes later I had a water in my hand, beaming, because I did all that just in Chinese. Yes. Yes. For most of the readers, this seems like non-point. An average every day occurrence. But for me, who don't have these opportunities, this was the start of big confidence booster and a very interesting journey with Chinese.\n<p>Later in the Hostel I sat and chilled in the lounge and heard one of the owners playing a beautiful Chinese song on guitar. I immediately told him it sounded great and asked the name of the song. He showed me his guitar tab book with the name. Just I was about to write it down, he said he had it on his phone. He sent it to me via bluetooth. The song's name was called 陌生人, which means stranger. I noticed 陌生人 three more times written on TV and across China. Now I'll never forget this word. Immersion is so easy! :)</p>\n<h2>Booking Hotels &amp; Renting Apartments</h2>\nI never spoke English to Chinese people. If I couldn't say what I wanted, I forced myself to try and explain. If my vocabulary failed me. I quickly pulled out my dictionary app. In Xiamen, I did not even have the opportunity to switch over to English, because frankly, it is far less pervasive than in Shanghai. I remember landing in Xiamen, heading straight to a hotel to book a room for two nights. To my surprise (I don't even know why? I should have expected this), they couldn't talk ANY English. I booked my room for two nights, I even went to check out the room before taking it, all in Chinese. I did however stumble a bit when they told about the free breakfast. They kept saying times, but I had no idea why. After some negotiation, I realized it was breakfast. My girlfriend somehow helped me on this too, 'cause they said the breakfast was “送”, but I haven't encountered this before. She said it was free. Like complimentary in a sense. She was right. In shops I often saw this: “买一送一” which means, buy one get one free!\n<p>The day after that I went in search for an apartment building to rent a short-term apartment. It was cheaper and more convenient (girlfriend could sleep over, had a fridge and a better view!). I did some research before I went to Xiamen and knew where to look. I found the offices, but I had no idea what to expect. I entered the lobby of the building asking the security personnel sitting behind the frontdesk how to get to the offices. They looked at me funny. I thought my Chinese was clear. After some talking and stumbling, I realized the frontdesk WAS the office. Had a chuckle. But I couldn't manage to book a room just yet, because it was too late in the day. I came back the morning to book a room. Then it hit me: I totally just rented an apartment all in Chinese. At first they couldn't understand why I would want to rent an apartment (guess they don't get many foreigners there), but I signed the contract and paid my deposit and got the key. Yay!</p>\n<p>I did read the contract (only in Chinese) first thing I put down my bags though. Just to make sure I didn't get screwed... even if I was, I already signed, but at least I could prepare myself.</p>\n<h2>A Visit to the Barber</h2>\nA few days later my girlfriend and some of her classmates decided to go for a haircut, Chinese style. I tagged along. In the end I got a haircut in typical androgynous Chinese boy band style. However, before we went I tried to look up words to use. Some like catalogue (编目) for example. I'd have no chance to explain the intricacies of a haircut and specialized vocab, but pictures always help. My girlfriend opted for big cut with straightening and everything. My cut was quick, but I ended chilling with the hairdressers, about 10 guys while my girlfriend got her cut. Throughout that time, about two hours, Chinese was spoken, from politics to clubs in Xiamen to even learning the hairdresser some English words. I laughed and joked around with them. I truly felt like being on top the conversations most of the time. Once again, my dictionary app worked overtime!\n<h2>The Flight Home</h2>\nOne last story.\n<p>One the way back from Shanghai to South Africa. I took the metro to Pudong Airport. An old man and what looked like her daughter sat across from me on the train most of the way. I stopped over in Kuala Lumpur for a few hours.

I recognized that she asked us what flavour of molasses we wanted for our hookah.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly asked the table for a preference and they replied with watermelon.

For some expats and other laowai these might be obvious, but I found this to be very useful.\\r\\n<h3>打包 (dǎbāo) - Take Away</h3>\\r\\nWith my girlfriend we'd often go to the Xiamen University canteens and order some delicious noodles, but because it was so ridiculously hot, we'd often get takeaways to go sit in air conditioned dorm rooms. I used this numerous times, from fast food to noodles shops.\\r\\n<h3>拉 - 推 (lā - tuī) - Pull- Push</h3>\\r\\nWritten on almost every door, these two characters indicate whether you should push or pull. So at the risk of embarrassment I had to learn these two really quick. Remember them. They are everywhere!\\r\\n<h3>不用 (bùyòng) - Need not</h3>\\r\\nI knew this before going to China, but this negative verb construction took on a new use in China. I think this is almost the closest you can get to saying \\\"No, thanks\\\" in Chinese without the extremely awkward literal translation “不，谢谢”. I used this a lot, for instance at convenience stores when they want to put something in a bag, you respond with 不用 if you don't want it. Mostly any request that you want to decline politely you can use this.\\r\\n<h3>打印 (dǎyìn) - To print</h3>\\r\\nWhile booking flights and hotels, I had to print e-tickets. Most Internet cafes or hostels have services, but you often need help. Thus 打印 is a very useful verb to know when you are travelling. While in Xiamen the one Internet cafe did not have printing services. So I asked where I could go. Luckily, just downstairs there was a printing/copying shop. Just look for big signs saying \\\"打印\\\" and you are set.\\r\\n<h3>押金 (yājīn) - Deposit</h3>\\r\\nBooking hotels or apartments almost always comes with a deposit. Thus, knowing this word helps a lot. It acts as a verb and noun. When booking my apartment in Xiamen, they shoved a paper for me to sign. I asked what it was, but they responded to quickly and couldn't understand. I read the slip quickly and noticed 押金 and my mind was at ease.\\r\\n<h3>免费 (miǎnfèi) - Free</h3>\\r\\nIf you are a traveller, or anyone really, this word is the word to look out for. You see this quite a few times, especially when booking for hotels. They often say 免费宽带 () which means free broadband and who wouldn't want that. I also saw it on a bank notice 开户免费, which you can open an account for free.\\r\\n<h3>朗姆可乐 (lǎngmǔ kělè) - Rum &amp; Coke</h3>\\r\\nAfter getting tired of beer, I was craving an alcohol mix. Usually in South Africa we mix brandy and coke, but the closest I got to that, was rum &amp; coke. This was typed on a menu. Note that both 朗姆 and 可乐 both sound like rum &amp; coke. So if you are craving rum and coke, 朗姆可乐 is the way to go.\\r\\n<h3>信用卡 (xìnyòngkǎ) - Credit Card</h3>\\r\\nOnce again, if you are travelling, this word becomes very useful. I often tried to find shops and people that used this. However, very few people used these in China. In the last hotel that I stayed they asked me for this as a deposit and possible damage covers. Very useful word.\\r\\n<h3>充值卡 (chōngzhí kǎ) - Recharge Card</h3>\\r\\nAnother card. Using a Chinese sim card is necessary if you don't want to run into massive roaming costs. However, when your airtime runs out you have to recharge. Just go up to mobile vendor, you'll see signs around, then ask for 充值卡 and how much you want. Just be sure to ask for the right operator too. I ended recharging 50kuai cards quite a few times, 'cause sending texts back home is quite expensive!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>While travelling I picked up really useful Chinese.

It acts as a verb and noun. When booking my apartment in Xiamen, they shoved a paper for me to sign. I asked what it was, but they responded to quickly and couldn't understand. I read the slip quickly and noticed 押金 and my mind was at ease.\n<h3>免费 (miǎnfèi) - Free</h3>\nIf you are a traveller, or anyone really, this word is the word to look out for. You see this quite a few times, especially when booking for hotels. They often say 免费宽带 () which means free broadband and who wouldn't want that. I also saw it on a bank notice 开户免费, which you can open an account for free.\n<h3>朗姆可乐 (lǎngmǔ kělè) - Rum &amp; Coke</h3>\nAfter getting tired of beer, I was craving an alcohol mix. Usually in South Africa we mix brandy and coke, but the closest I got to that, was rum &amp; coke. This was typed on a menu. Note that both 朗姆 and 可乐 both sound like rum &amp; coke. So if you are craving rum and coke, 朗姆可乐 is the way to go.\n<h3>信用卡 (xìnyòngkǎ) - Credit Card</h3>\nOnce again, if you are travelling, this word becomes very useful. I often tried to find shops and people that used this. However, very few people used these in China. In the last hotel that I stayed they asked me for this as a deposit and possible damage covers. Very useful word.\n<h3>充值卡 (chōngzhí kǎ) - Recharge Card</h3>\nAnother card. Using a Chinese sim card is necessary if you don't want to run into massive roaming costs. However, when your airtime runs out you have to recharge. Just go up to mobile vendor, you'll see signs around, then ask for 充值卡 and how much you want. Just be sure to ask for the right operator too. I ended recharging 50kuai cards quite a few times, 'cause sending texts back home is quite expensive!</div>","amp":"80","plaintext":"While travelling I picked up really useful Chinese. For some expats and other\nlaowai these might be obvious, but I found this to be very useful.\n\n打包 (dǎbāo) - Take Away\nWith my girlfriend we'd often go to the Xiamen University canteens and order\nsome delicious noodles, but because it was so ridiculously hot, we'd often get\ntakeaways to go sit in air conditioned dorm rooms. I used this numerous times,\nfrom fast food to noodles shops.拉 - 推 (lā - tuī) - Pull- Push\nWritten on almost every door, these two characters indicate whether you should\npush or pull. So at the risk of embarrassment I had to learn these two really\nquick. Remember them. They are everywhere!不用 (bùyòng) - Need not\nI knew this before going to China, but this negative verb construction took on a\nnew use in China. I think this is almost the closest you can get to saying \"No,\nthanks\" in Chinese without the extremely awkward literal translation “不，谢谢”. I\nused this a lot, for instance at convenience stores when they want to put\nsomething in a bag, you respond with 不用 if you don't want it. Mostly any request\nthat you want to decline politely you can use this.打印 (dǎyìn) - To print\nWhile booking flights and hotels, I had to print e-tickets. Most Internet cafes\nor hostels have services, but you often need help. Thus 打印 is a very useful verb\nto know when you are travelling. While in Xiamen the one Internet cafe did not\nhave printing services. So I asked where I could go. Luckily, just downstairs\nthere was a printing/copying shop. Just look for big signs saying \"打印\" and you\nare set.押金 (yājīn) - Deposit\nBooking hotels or apartments almost always comes with a deposit. Thus, knowing\nthis word helps a lot. It acts as a verb and noun. When booking my apartment in\nXiamen, they shoved a paper for me to sign. I asked what it was, but they\nresponded to quickly and couldn't understand.

They often\nsay 免费宽带 () which means free broadband and who wouldn't want that. I also saw it\non a bank notice 开户免费, which you can open an account for free.朗姆可乐 (lǎngmǔ kělè)\n- Rum & Coke\nAfter getting tired of beer, I was craving an alcohol mix.

So here are some interesting words from the lyrics.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>举起 - Jǔ qǐ</h3>\\r\\nIt means to raise or to lift. It occurs in the lyric: 大家<strong>举起</strong>手来，which means, everybody put your hands in the air. Think of rappers at the concert shouting, \\\"Put your hands up in the air\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>准 - Zhǔn</h3>\\r\\nThis means, to grant/allow. I have seen this before in 准备, which means to prepare/get ready, but haven't seen it on its own before. It occurs in the lyric： 准让你们大饱耳福 - which Feichang Fresh translates as giving/granting you all an eargasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>伴奏 - Bànzòu</h3>\\r\\nThis was an interesting one. It means to accompany (musically). So you accompany someone doing a recital with a guitar etc etc, but the way that this is used in the song and the way Feichang Fresh translates it is like this: 放伴奏 - Drop the Beat. 放 means to release/set free, so this makes sense. You release the accompanying music.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>黎明 - Límíng</h3>\\r\\nThis means daybreak/dawn and occurs in the first line of the chorus: 每到黎明听着你的声音来把我叫醒.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>叫醒 - Jiào xǐng</h3>\\r\\nAlso a cool word, that means to rouse or to awaken. I like it because it is formed with 叫 and 醒，the former meaning to call/shout and the latter to awaken. It also occurs in the first line of the chorus: 每到黎明听着你的声音来把我叫醒 - which here means: to be awaken while listening to the sounds of Beijing's break of dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>灵魂 - Línghún</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means soul/spirit and occurs in the lyric: 北京的灵魂氛围难以用语言来表达. Combined with the next word it makes more sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>氛围 - Fēnwéi</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means ambience/atmosphere. Connected with 灵魂 it creates an encompassing soul and ambience of a place. In this case Beijing. The lyrics above means: It is hard to describe Beijing's soul and atmosphere using words.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>了不起 - Liǎobùqǐ</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words seem to be a dime a dozen in any language. The English equivalent would be awesome. Others include: 酷，牛逼，厉害。\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>舍不得 - Shěbude</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means, hard to do something. It is used in the lyric: 我真是舍不得离开. It talks about it being hard to leave Beijing.\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>环 - Huán</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis word is used to describe rings usually, but here it means the district rings of the city. 1 being the city center and 6 being the outer skirts of the city. They use it in the line: 一二三环不管什么地方，which is a call to the people in ring 1-3, regardless of what place.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid you find the song great? The Beijing accent is also very strong, which makes some lines almost jokingly not understandable. I quite like the Beijing accent though.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>You might have heard of these guys.

When I first heard it. I couldn't stop listening. Not\nonly is it sung by laowai, but the song is incredibly catchy. The song has been\non repeat in my car. Even my non-Chinese learning friends are voicing along the\nsounds. I knew about 80% of the lyrics. So I recently went back to the song\nonline and found the lyrics and just took out some interesting words that I did\nnot know. But before we commence. Here is the awesome video.\n\nAwesome right? So here are some interesting words from the lyrics.\n\n举起 - Jǔ qǐ\nIt means to raise or to lift. It occurs in the lyric: 大家举起手来，which means,\neverybody put your hands in the air. Think of rappers at the concert shouting,\n\"Put your hands up in the air\".准 - Zhǔn\nThis means, to grant/allow. I have seen this before in 准备, which means to\nprepare/get ready, but haven't seen it on its own before. It occurs in the\nlyric： 准让你们大饱耳福 - which Feichang Fresh translates as giving/granting you all an\neargasm.伴奏 - Bànzòu\nThis was an interesting one. It means to accompany (musically). So you accompany\nsomeone doing a recital with a guitar etc etc, but the way that this is used in\nthe song and the way Feichang Fresh translates it is like this: 放伴奏 - Drop the\nBeat. 放 means to release/set free, so this makes sense. You release the\naccompanying music.黎明 - Límíng\nThis means daybreak/dawn and occurs in the first line of the chorus:\n每到黎明听着你的声音来把我叫醒.叫醒 - Jiào xǐng\nAlso a cool word, that means to rouse or to awaken. I like it because it is\nformed with 叫 and 醒，the former meaning to call/shout and the latter to awaken.\nIt also occurs in the first line of the chorus: 每到黎明听着你的声音来把我叫醒 - which here\nmeans: to be awaken while listening to the sounds of Beijing's break of dawn.灵魂\n- Línghún\nThis means soul/spirit and occurs in the lyric: 北京的灵魂氛围难以用语言来表达. Combined with\nthe next word it makes more sense.\n\n氛围 - Fēnwéi\nThis means ambience/atmosphere. Connected with 灵魂 it creates an encompassing\nsoul and ambience of a place. In this case Beijing. The lyrics above means: It\nis hard to describe Beijing's soul and atmosphere using words.\n\n了不起 - Liǎobùqǐ\nThese words seem to be a dime a dozen in any language. The English equivalent\nwould be awesome. Others include: 酷，牛逼，厉害。\n\n舍不得 - Shěbude\nThis means, hard to do something. It is used in the lyric: 我真是舍不得离开. It talks\nabout it being hard to leave Beijing.\n\n环 - Huán\nThis word is used to describe rings usually, but here it means the district\nrings of the city. 1 being the city center and 6 being the outer skirts of the\ncity. They use it in the line: 一二三环不管什么地方，which is a call to the people in ring\n1-3, regardless of what place.\n\nDid you find the song great?

It allowed to use writing as a distraction. But again... bam. I failed in keeping it up (no! Not that kind of failure!).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo where is my problem? Why can't I use SRS systems as a long-term solution in acquiring vocabulary?\\r\\n<h3>Learning through repetition is just not for me</h3>\\r\\nIn fact repetition in all things, bores me very quickly. I remember playing World of Warcraft (the most popular MMORPG out there) back when it came out. I quit after playing for three months. My friends all played for many years after that. Many quests involved grinding, which has you killing a random amount of creeps (creatures) for the chance of getting an item that drops upon the killing it. Usually you have to get a certain amount of these items. For example: Collect 10 tusks by killing Wild Boars.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt just got so boring. I ended not doing the quests anymore and entertained myself by selling items for profit in the in-game auction house, making lots of gold, far succeeding what a character at that level should have. This was far more challenging and exciting. This brings me to my next point.\\r\\n<h3>SRS Systems are devoid of excitement and challenges</h3>\\r\\nHello there unknown word. Oh, I don't know you. Click to see definition. Ok see you later... This is the crux of Anki. Yes, yes. It's very bluntly put, but really what excitement does it offer? Maybe I'm silly in expecting some kind of magical orchestra every time I put a word in the easy category, but it just is not engaging. Skritter again solves this somewhat, by having you engage by actually writing it, but the novelty soon wears off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe challenge is also very linear and predictable. Yes, I can change the amount of new words everyday, but most of the work is done behind the scenes. The SRS algorithm takes control of your learning. Where is my autonomy? This is not challenging. Remembering is not challenging. It is just takes effort. Effort =/= Challenging.\\r\\n<h3>I'm not feeling like I'm mastering anything</h3>\\r\\nThe things that I enjoy doing, like playing guitar and computer games, allows me to master something. Learning languages, also allow me this. The reward in gaining a language is intrinsically there, but SRS systems removes this context. The \\\"decks\\\" are removed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is what a lot of people claim against SRS/Flashcards, in that they don't provide context. But there is definitely a way to incorporate this into your SRS system. For instance, adding words and sentences from a book you are reading. This I admit is my undoing. Fast forward to the next point.\\r\\n<h3>My attention span and self-discipline sucks. Also I'm lazy</h3>\\r\\nIf I really want to make progress in SRS, I have to put 20minutes in everyday. God! That's only 20min. Why don't I have that self-discipline to do just that? This relates to other points: SRS feels like a chore. I much rather listen to Chinese music, read blogs or watch movies. Even participate in other Chinese related activities. It is much more rewarding and doesn't feel like a chore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had the self-discipline to persevere in SRS, I'd be able to do it, but I guess I have a low tolerance for repetition (as evident from the WoW example), and much rather sooner find more entertaining options. This low tolerance also comes from a lack of attention span. I'm easily distracted. Something I'll have to work on for sure.\\r\\n<h3>Chinese offers a unique problem</h3>\\r\\nChinese is a logographic language, but this offers an interesting disconnect that only arises in Chinese. The pronunciation, meaning and character and their relationships are irregular. So, once you see a character, not only do you have to remember the pronunciation, but ALSO the meaning. This makes for much heavier cognitive load.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no regularity or prediction available in either getting the meaning or pronunciation from a character. Yes, some characters have phonetic and semantic radical information encoded that provide this information, but it is just way too irregular to trust radicals and characters for that kind of information. It will remain arbitrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere another language, Spanish for instance, you just have to guess the meaning, because the form (the written word) contains the pronunciation.\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\nHow do you use flashcards? Please please please, I beg you! Leave a comment below.

The basic gist of this project is to\ncreate a fascinating story centered around Princess Moonface (Mei) that is\ncoupled with different multimedia aids and websites and content. They aim the\ncontent for Tweens to Young Adults.\n\nThey are using quite a variance of talent to get this project going, but they\nneed more capital to complete it. This is where Kickstarter comes in.\n\nI'm going to pledge, because I like to support projects like this. They are 9\ndays away from hitting their target. I'm not sure if the product will be useful\nor even exciting as they claim. I'm also skeptical of their synchronous\ntranslation method. I've never been a fan of this kind of writing (mixing pinyin\n& English with characters and even Chinese-Ordered English\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/05/chinese-ordered-english/]) and being an\nacademic, I'd like to read the research around this method. Can they back this\nup?\n\nAlso, I hope they make doubly sure that everything is correct.

It's different. Notice the 匕 radical underneath the 勹 radical. That is not normal. Then I went on a search, for I remembered the character was written differently. I consulted my Hanping Dictionary app on my phone and also checked the Oxford Chinese-English Dictionary on my desk. They both had the version I remember it as. However, now here comes the interesting part. I looked around for that version online. Why was my MacBook displaying it differently? I couldn't find a version online! Then it dawned on me. Maybe it's my browser, but it wasn't, because after copying the character into a simple text editor it still displays the same. Also, my popup dictionary (<a href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/04/google-chrome-translator-plugin-zhongwen/\\\">Zhongwen for Chrome</a>, which uses CEDICT) still detected it as 喝. So in essence it was the SAME character.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy investigation went further. I looked up the Unicode for 喝 and found <a href=\\\"http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E5%96%9D\\\">this in their Unihan database</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837434/Screen-Shot-2011-10-23-at-10_32_09-AM_mnau92.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-679\\\" title=\\\"Unicode for 喝\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837434/Screen-Shot-2011-10-23-at-10_32_09-AM_mnau92.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"425\\\" height=\\\"115\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nAHA! I knew I wasn't drunk or something! See there. The Unicode standard is how I remember it. From the dictionaries and during my Uni classes. However, it should be added that it isn't entirely my browser's fault. It is my whole computer. I tested this out and visited the same link on my Windows machine. It matched the Unicode standard.\\r\\n<h3>Kanji not Hanzi!</h3>\\r\\nAt first I thought it was my browser or even my Pinyin IME, but now it must be my MacBook. It baffles that there is a difference! I'm not a big know-how on Chinese Character encoding, especially Unicode, but I doubt it would work this way. The thing is, it is the SAME character! My pop-up dictionary picks it up. I looked at my text-editor to see if has something to do with the fonts that my MacBook uses. I noticed the font was unfamiliar. It's called Hiragino Mincho. Yes, that's Japanese!\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually the standard font for Chinese is the Song font. I never installed these fonts. They came with the MacBook. I decided to look up a bit more to see if the Kanji version looked different. Check this <a href=\\\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%96%9D\\\">Wiktionary for 喝</a>. It does! See there. It shows the different variants. I changed my font in the text editor and I got the Hanzi version back, by using the Song font. However, now there's my browser. The weird thing is, looking at the Wiktionary page, it shows both versions of the character. Now this is getting weird.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can my browser show two versions of the same character? If they are technically the same Unicode!?\\r\\n<h3>Variant Characters in Unicode</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">After some more investigation. Yes, I need a drink by now! I found out that Unicode encoding has variants based on the language <a href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/09/defining-sinosphere/\\\">in the Sinosphere</a>. Check this article out on Wikipedia, called <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification\\\">Han Unification</a>. There's a table there that is supposed to show different variants of the same character, with the same Unicode, but different based on language. I checked my settings on my MacBook. I found out that it was giving priority to Kanji over Hanzi.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">I finally see the correct 喝 now! However, for some reason I still can't get that table to show the different variants in the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification\\\">Han Unification</a> page. It only shows me the Hanzi version now. Oh well, that's a problem for another day. I think it might something to do with the type of font. For now I'm glad that I can see the old 喝 again.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">---------------</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><em>P.S. - Please visit that Han Unification link and tell me if you are seeing different characters or not in the examples of language dependent characters table!</em></p>\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>Heyoooo.

Gotta love sensationalist headlines right!? Don't worry this is not a\nhungover post or drunk blogging, but rather an interesting thing I noticed the\nother day. I was busy creating a website (which will be online tomorrow, so\nexpect another blog post tomorrow or Tuesday) when I typed the character for\ndrinking. You all know it. It is written as 喝.\n\nHowever, something strange happened. The character was different. Now let me\nshow you the bigger picture. Here is how the character came out as:\n\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837435/Screen-Shot-2011-10-23-at-10_18_53-AM_qmpfee.png]\n\nNow, if you know your drinking, you would notice that, that character is not\nentirely right. It's different. Notice the 匕 radical underneath the 勹 radical.\nThat is not normal. Then I went on a search, for I remembered the character was\nwritten differently. I consulted my Hanping Dictionary app on my phone and also\nchecked the Oxford Chinese-English Dictionary on my desk. They both had the\nversion I remember it as. However, now here comes the interesting part. I looked\naround for that version online. Why was my MacBook displaying it differently? I\ncouldn't find a version online! Then it dawned on me. Maybe it's my browser, but\nit wasn't, because after copying the character into a simple text editor it\nstill displays the same. Also, my popup dictionary (Zhongwen for Chrome\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/04/google-chrome-translator-plugin-zhongwen/],\nwhich uses CEDICT) still detected it as 喝.

So without further ado,\nhappy two years for me and this blog. 生日快乐 and all that jazz. Since the blog has\nstarted in December 2009, 88 posts have been published. Hooray. Not that much,\nbut I prefer quality over quantity. :)\n\nThis blog has become a turning point in my dedication to learning Chinese. It's\namazing to have a community that helps you figure out the language and sharing\nit with them. Not only that, but I enjoy being able to share my troubles.\nWriting about something, like the 喝 post\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/10/drinking-problem/]  actually made me figure\nout what was happening. It was like a \"real-time\" detective post. While I was\nwriting the post I was doing research on it. Same with the recent 青 troubles\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/11/color-%E9%9D%92-really-blue-green-help/].\n\nEveryday that people talk about and link my blog, I'm humbled that people enjoy\nmy posts. I get new readers everyday (hi to the new readers!) and this makes\nwriting about the language and sharing my learning experience so much more\nrewarding.

I doubt you'd see some using 圕 in a sentence, but it's interesting nonetheless. This actually reminds me, <a href=\\\"http://eastasiastudent.net/about\\\">East Asia Student</a>'s Logo is also a  ligature! 東 + 囗!\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837350/EAS-dong-ligature_tdtbpd.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-769\\\" title=\\\"EAS-dong-ligature\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837350/EAS-dong-ligature_tdtbpd.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"128\\\" height=\\\"128\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I hear you ask? Aren't all Chinese character actually ligatures? Well, yes and no.

But do read please]</em>\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the language learning community is buzzing, especially the Chinese one, with the news that Benny is attempting <a href=\\\"http://www.fluentin3months.com/mandarin-mission/\\\">to become fluent in Mandarin in 3 Months</a>. Now, phew, where to start on this doozy of a topic. I remember writing about this briefly last year, asking <a title=\\\"How long does it take to learn Chinese?\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/07/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-chinese/\\\">How Long does it take to Learn Chinese?</a> A few others have already posted their thoughts on Benny's mission: <a href=\\\"http://sarajaaksola.com/becoming-fluent-in-chinese/\\\">Sara Jaaksola</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.hackingchinese.com/?p=1028\\\">Olle Linge</a>. It pretty much echoes what most people are saying, that Benny is in over his head, but it's not impossible. Reddit also had a <a href=\\\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/o7unk/some_guys_plan_to_speak_fluent_chinese_from/\\\">bit of go at Benny</a> (with him posting there himself).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some topics I'd like to discuss concerning his mission as a language learner, linguist and Chinese enthusiast in response to Benny and lots of others things in terms of language learning.\\r\\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\\r\\nI've been following Benny and other polyglot blogs for some time now. I find their dedication and admiration for learning languages inspiring. But, I've always had a mixed feeling of disdain, jealously and hope when reading his and other people's blogs. On one side, these people rock. The more people are inspiring and blogging about languages the better, but sometimes these goals that the polyglots put on themselves becomes pride, and turns into a stubborn defense mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have found this on a few of these blogs. I remember being banned from commenting on <a title=\\\"Flashcards and Second Language Acquisition\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/11/flashcards-and-second-language-acquisition/\\\">a site for questioning statements</a>. There is a divide between language learners, linguists and bloggers. This is a topic I also talked about in much depth with Benny on his <a href=\\\"http://www.fluentin3months.com/linguists/\\\">blog post about linguists</a>. Here in lies the problem.\\r\\n<h3>The Experience Paradox</h3>\\r\\nThis can be applied to many things, but this is especially applicable to language learning, as it is a very personal subjective experience. Let's take an example here to clarify my problem:\\r\\n\\r\\nSay I have learned Chinese by listening to Chinese TV all waking hours of my life and then after 4 months start talking fluent Mandarin, my method was a success. To me that is. Now if Joe comes to me and says, what I say is a wrong way of learning Chinese, because I should have listened to Chinese Music for 3 months, then I'd be more advanced, because this is what Joe has done, therefore my approach is invalid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument is dead from the start. No-one will budge. Subjective experience becomes subjectively true.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when claims are made from a linguistics objective perspective, based on research, then I hope, this is what has been missing from most polyglot blogs, is the tendency to avoid accepting defeat and or altering their \\\"trusted\\\" methods due to research and/or suggestions. HOWEVER, it must be added that even if the response is not given from objective point of view, then the learner must be willing to explore other methods, or at least accept that other methods might work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat's the whole beauty of learning languages. There is no ultimate way of doing it. I recommend reading this book/research, about <a href=\\\"http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/booksbackinprint/successwithforeignlanguages/success.pdf\\\">success in learning languages</a>. It covers seven different types of successful language learners. Basically, it shows just how different methods and attitudes can achieve the same goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same way that some people are stubborn in their ways about many things in life, the same way polyglots are (mostly) stubborn about their methods. Having a public blog, opens this up to scrutiny. The motivation to pursue a blog becomes suspicious. It begs the question, <strong>if you are learning languages should you also not be willing to learn how to learn languages too</strong>? Meta-linguistics skills is also something that I have talked about before when asking the question about whether <a title=\\\"Is Chinese a good choice for your first foreign language?\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/11/is-chinese-a-good-choice-for-your-first-foreign-language/\\\">Chinese is a good first foreign language to learn</a>?\\r\\n<h3>Relative difficulty is a real thing</h3>\\r\\nNow this is something that bothers me the most about some polyglot blogs, is the idea that there are no hard languages. Objectively yes, relatively... nope. The difference between languages becomes a hurdle in terms of acquiring that language. It is simply there. This phenomenon exists. However, tackling the idea of hard/difficult languages becomes two-fold.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have found this many times when people respond to me when I say that I learn Chinese, \\\"Wow, it must be tough learning the hardest language in the world!\\\" I usually just play along, and due to social etiquette I refrain from rambling linguistic nonsense to prove my point. But the fact remains, that there is a belief that there are objectively hard languages. My dad is even a culprit of this. When he sees me writing Chinese, he goes, \\\"Why are they still using a primitive writing system?\\\". <strong>We need to distill this belief and let people know that there is relative difficulty in acquiring languages</strong>. I can acquire Dutch relatively easy due to my Afrikaans background, but learning Mandarin, hell no.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, Benny, always points out that there is no such thing as a hard language. I have read his blog and the language hacking guide and I admire the tenacity to instill this idea. It definitely works and helps people overcome the mental block. Anyone can acquire any language. But let's not kid ourselves, some languages are going to be more difficult than others to acquire. More time needs to be invested to achieve the same results. Acceptance of this, need not be a stumbling block, but in fact a challenge and more motivation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI predict a post from Benny that will say that Mandarin is not that hard. He has already posted this idea as a comment on his Youtube vide0.\\r\\n<blockquote>Chinese is so logical in so many ways, and I will be writing a post later to ENCOURAGE learners who want to take it on, especially comparing it to European languages. I think it's just so exaggerated to say a European language is easier. I can give lots of examples, and will later.</blockquote>\\r\\nLike I said, objectively yes, relatively no, not if you're coming from a certain language background. Benny however has the meta-linguistic experience to overcome these differences more readily than others, but the fact remains that, <strong>it is harder to learn</strong>. For more about my idea on Chinese Grammar, <a title=\\\"A rant on Chinese’s Easy Grammar\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/05/rant-chineses-easy-grammar/\\\">click here.</a>\\r\\n<h3>Time becomes a measure of success</h3>\\r\\nThis is found in many aspects of life, the idea that the quicker one can achieve the same goals, the better the success is. I've been learning Chinese now for four years. It's been an amazing ride so far. However, I'm nowhere near the level of many others who have been studying it for four years in China. Or even have better self-discipline. Time and time again, <strong>validity of methods and success is measured in the time spent achieving a level of fluency.</strong> I absolutely deplore this and is often seen as a weak spot for someone's language learning prowess. \\\"Oh you only learned how to order a meal after one year!? You are obviously doing something wrong. So your argument is invalid\\\". Time =/= success\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccess should be measured by personal growth and self-reward. Heck I was elated that I could <a href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/07/china-2-language-experience/\\\">rent my own apartment using Chinese</a> after three and a half years. But sometimes, the reward could come from pushing yourself to achieve something within a time period. That's why I don't discredit people studying this way, but once again, it becomes a pride thing. It serves as a foundation for criticizing others lack of vigor, motivation and methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nI predict I'm going to be a life long learner of Chinese. I love going into the intricacies of the language. I don't think I'd want to skim over languages and push the envelope. But hey, each to his own.\\r\\n<h3>A Theory on Beginner Chinese</h3>\\r\\nNow, to Benny's mission. He will have measured success in speaking. But not reading, that's a whole different topic for another day. Chinese is extremely unique in that aspect and requires a whole post for itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837352/chinesejapanese_fb3dif.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-758\\\" title=\\\"chinesejapanese\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837352/chinesejapanese_fb3dif.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"480\\\" height=\\\"935\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Pasden made this post some time ago. Although it compares <a href=\\\"http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2008/06/25/learning-curves-chinese-vs-japanese\\\">Japanese vs Chinese</a>, it makes an interesting point that I'd like to discuss, which might throw things off a bit, but I'd like your input. Here's my theory:\\r\\n<blockquote>Learning Chinese becomes more difficult as you learn more.</blockquote>\\r\\nOoooh. Insightful! But allow me to explain.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese has 400 syllables. ONLY 400 syllables (excluding tones), with English for example having thousands of different syllables. This makes Chinese extremely homophonic. Now, concerning the question of tones, it makes the homophony a bit less daunting, but does it really?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's consider a beginner Chinese learner. Tones are being learned, but due to uniqueness of the tones, its importance is underestimated due to not being used to saying words with tones. That's what I did and is a <a title=\\\"5 Mistakes I made when I started learning Chinese\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/04/5-mistakes-i-made-when-i-started-learning-chinese/\\\">crucial mistake when starting Chinese</a>. But, context plays a good role aiding the learner to not completely feel helpless when using tones and conversing with Chinese. I have found this quite often. When saying a single word, to explain something, I often get weird looks. Yep tones are wrong, but when used in a sentence with other sounds, <strong>the context corrects my failure in mispronunciation of the tone. </strong>So by definition, I can converse to some extent with Chinese, without focusing on tones that much.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the complexity comes in and homophony kicks you in the ass for not paying attention to tones. Now, what happens when you go further with learning Chinese? You start encountering syllables with the same sounds, but different tones, which makes the meaning completely different. Now context can save you again, yes, but it becomes increasingly difficult due to being exposed to the different words. Either you understood before or not, but now if you don't understand the word in context, a second set doubt kicks in trying hard to get those tone associations going.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet's take an example:\\r\\n\\r\\n时间, which means time. A normal word learned early in Chinese.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow look at all the other possible words for the same two syllables, but different tones:\\r\\n\\r\\n实践\\r\\n\\r\\n事件\\r\\n\\r\\n世间\\r\\n\\r\\n尸检\\r\\n\\r\\n时艰\\r\\n\\r\\n识见\\r\\n\\r\\nand more. Now, the confusion sets in. That's why I think, it's possible to get by with beginner Chinese without focusing that much on tones. You just have to get some tones right. I know this might sound a bit controversial, but that's why I think Benny will succeed if his tones are poor. And let's be honest, tones take a long time to master. However, Benny is an extremely good pragmatic observer. I have seen it before in his posts. Context plays a vital role in early acquisition. He will use it to his advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be added however that I do not know where this ceiling in beginner Chinese is. He will apparently record a spontaneous interview at the end of the three months. It will extremely interesting to see how he does. If he controls the conversation within a framework of his understanding AND have not surpassed this ceiling, he will be able to communicate. <strong>His tones will probably be wrong, but he will be understood. </strong>Unfortunately, his goal of C1 is completely misplaced. That would be comparable to between HSK 5-6, even maybe above 6, because academic Chinese is not for the faint hearted. Conversational Chinese is much more realistic, albeit still a great deal of work.\\r\\n<h3>What impact is this leaving for language learners?</h3>\\r\\nMotivation is a crucial crucial part of language learning. For that I give immense claim to Benny. He is excellent in that regard. I mean, who doesn't want to do what he does. Speak from day 1! I wholeheartedly agree. I've read his Language Hacking Guide, and one point stood out to me, if you really want to excel in language learning change your \\\"want\\\" to a \\\"need\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people will achieve success in following Benny's methods. However, with great power comes great responsibility. That's why I feel that sometimes, starting missions like this, where you have to prove to the public your goal, you might mislead the audience into false hope and misinformation regarding languages. Like the idea above that is mentioned about relative difficulty in second language acquisition.\\r\\n<h3>What will the response be to Benny's results?</h3>\\r\\nNow let's forward till the end of Benny's mission and imagine two scenarios:\\r\\n\\r\\nA) He was successfull\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople will respond with congratulations of course, but most people will respond with a distrust in his claims. This is because of his goal. I'm sure critique will come from many avenues. Many won't believe him.\\r\\n\\r\\nB) He failed\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be a first for Benny. If he admits it, but I'm sure, lots and lots of people will respond with an \\\"Aha told you so!\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth responses will lead to a negative response in my opinion and I think that's sad. When opened to public scrutiny, especially with such a lofty goal, proving something to others becomes a nasty thing. That's where I think an unfortunate thing occurs, <strong>when you have a product to sell and it's your living, then you have to prove your methods work, otherwise your product fails. </strong>Benny looks like an amazing guy. I'm sure I'd love to sit with with him over a few beers and talk about the world and travelling. But sometimes, like many people, we will disagree about things. I would say that I love learning languages, but I'm a more methodological learner. I love going after the small things. Heck, why will I spend the whole day researching character encoding just 'cause <a title=\\\"I have a drinking problem\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/10/drinking-problem/\\\">I noticed a small change in a character</a>? I'd like to become fluent in a language. He will respond that he also likes to becomes fluent in a language, but in a lot of them. I'm sure we will agree that both sides are good.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I'll ask him one final question, Benny, have you ever considered that if you fail in your Mandarin mission, to admit it and learn from your mistakes? Because I believe, someone in your position, can teach us a lot more about learning languages, especially if you have failed, than many other people out there. You have spent many years perfecting your technique, why not now again?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then he'll respond, \\\"I might just prove you all wrong\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that ladies and gentlemen is the whole crux of the matter. One can go on and on about learning languages (like I have now!), but sometimes, you can, and I really believe this, achieve a lot in 3 months of learning a language. No, he doesn't have a language gene or a natural talent, it all comes down to pure tenacity of it all. We are all skeptics, and that's good, I'm one of them. Mandarin really is the top of languages to conquer for an English speaking person.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the back of my mind I want Benny to fail. I know it sounds bad. But hear me out. If he fails and is willing to accept that Chinese is a tough language and works hard to conquer that failure, we as a Chinese learning community can then constructively help each others to achieve the same goals, whether it's 3 months or 4 years. There is no magic formula to this. Sometimes we wish there was. That's why Benny is great, 'cause he makes us believe that. But sometimes, you get hit with a language like Chinese and all previous conventions gets thrown out the window. That's why I love it. And I hope that's what Benny will find too.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p><em>[P.S - you are in for big post here!

I can acquire Dutch relatively easy due to my Afrikaans background, but learning Mandarin, hell no.</p>\n<p>But, Benny, always points out that there is no such thing as a hard language. I have read his blog and the language hacking guide and I admire the tenacity to instill this idea. It definitely works and helps people overcome the mental block. Anyone can acquire any language. But let's not kid ourselves, some languages are going to be more difficult than others to acquire. More time needs to be invested to achieve the same results.

Benny however has the meta-linguistic experience to overcome these differences more readily than others, but the fact remains that, <strong>it is harder to learn</strong>.

I've been learning Chinese now for four years. It's been an amazing ride so far. However, I'm nowhere near the level of many others who have been studying it for four years in China. Or even have better self-discipline. Time and time again, <strong>validity of methods and success is measured in the time spent achieving a level of fluency.</strong> I absolutely deplore this and is often seen as a weak spot for someone's language learning prowess. \"Oh you only learned how to order a meal after one year!? You are obviously doing something wrong. So your argument is invalid\". Time =/= success\n<p>Success should be measured by personal growth and self-reward. Heck I was elated that I could <a href=\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/07/china-2-language-experience/\">rent my own apartment using Chinese</a> after three and a half years. But sometimes, the reward could come from pushing yourself to achieve something within a time period. That's why I don't discredit people studying this way, but once again, it becomes a pride thing. It serves as a foundation for criticizing others lack of vigor, motivation and methods.</p>\n<p>I predict I'm going to be a life long learner of Chinese. I love going into the intricacies of the language. I don't think I'd want to skim over languages and push the envelope. But hey, each to his own.</p>\n<h3>A Theory on Beginner Chinese</h3>\nNow, to Benny's mission. He will have measured success in speaking. But not reading, that's a whole different topic for another day. Chinese is extremely unique in that aspect and requires a whole post for itself.\n<p><a href=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837352/chinesejapanese_fb3dif.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-758\" title=\"chinesejapanese\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837352/chinesejapanese_fb3dif.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"935\" /></a></p>\n<p>John Pasden made this post some time ago. Although it compares <a href=\"http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2008/06/25/learning-curves-chinese-vs-japanese\">Japanese vs Chinese</a>, it makes an interesting point that I'd like to discuss, which might throw things off a bit, but I'd like your input. Here's my theory:</p>\n<blockquote>Learning Chinese becomes more difficult as you learn more.</blockquote>\nOoooh. Insightful! But allow me to explain.\n<p>Chinese has 400 syllables. ONLY 400 syllables (excluding tones), with English for example having thousands of different syllables. This makes Chinese extremely homophonic. Now, concerning the question of tones, it makes the homophony a bit less daunting, but does it really?</p>\n<p>Let's consider a beginner Chinese learner. Tones are being learned, but due to uniqueness of the tones, its importance is underestimated due to not being used to saying words with tones. That's what I did and is a <a title=\"5 Mistakes I made when I started learning Chinese\" href=\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/04/5-mistakes-i-made-when-i-started-learning-chinese/\">crucial mistake when starting Chinese</a>. But, context plays a good role aiding the learner to not completely feel helpless when using tones and conversing with Chinese. I have found this quite often. When saying a single word, to explain something, I often get weird looks. Yep tones are wrong, but when used in a sentence with other sounds, <strong>the context corrects my failure in mispronunciation of the tone. </strong>So by definition, I can converse to some extent with Chinese, without focusing on tones that much.</p>\n<p>Until the complexity comes in and homophony kicks you in the ass for not paying attention to tones. Now, what happens when you go further with learning Chinese? You start encountering syllables with the same sounds, but different tones, which makes the meaning completely different. Now context can save you again, yes, but it becomes increasingly difficult due to being exposed to the different words. Either you understood before or not, but now if you don't understand the word in context, a second set doubt kicks in trying hard to get those tone associations going.</p>\n<p>Let's take an example:</p>\n<p>时间, which means time. A normal word learned early in Chinese.</p>\n<p>Now look at all the other possible words for the same two syllables, but different tones:</p>\n<p>实践</p>\n<p>事件</p>\n<p>世间</p>\n<p>尸检</p>\n<p>时艰</p>\n<p>识见</p>\n<p>and more. Now, the confusion sets in. That's why I think, it's possible to get by with beginner Chinese without focusing that much on tones. You just have to get some tones right. I know this might sound a bit controversial, but that's why I think Benny will succeed if his tones are poor. And let's be honest, tones take a long time to master. However, Benny is an extremely good pragmatic observer. I have seen it before in his posts. Context plays a vital role in early acquisition. He will use it to his advantage.</p>\n<p>It must be added however that I do not know where this ceiling in beginner Chinese is. He will apparently record a spontaneous interview at the end of the three months. It will extremely interesting to see how he does. If he controls the conversation within a framework of his understanding AND have not surpassed this ceiling, he will be able to communicate. <strong>His tones will probably be wrong, but he will be understood. </strong>Unfortunately, his goal of C1 is completely misplaced. That would be comparable to between HSK 5-6, even maybe above 6, because academic Chinese is not for the faint hearted. Conversational Chinese is much more realistic, albeit still a great deal of work.</p>\n<h3>What impact is this leaving for language learners?</h3>\nMotivation is a crucial crucial part of language learning. For that I give immense claim to Benny. He is excellent in that regard. I mean, who doesn't want to do what he does. Speak from day 1! I wholeheartedly agree. I've read his Language Hacking Guide, and one point stood out to me, if you really want to excel in language learning change your \"want\" to a \"need\".\n<p>Many people will achieve success in following Benny's methods. However, with great power comes great responsibility. That's why I feel that sometimes, starting missions like this, where you have to prove to the public your goal, you might mislead the audience into false hope and misinformation regarding languages. Like the idea above that is mentioned about relative difficulty in second language acquisition.</p>\n<h3>What will the response be to Benny's results?</h3>\nNow let's forward till the end of Benny's mission and imagine two scenarios:\n<p>A) He was successfull</p>\n<p>People will respond with congratulations of course, but most people will respond with a distrust in his claims. This is because of his goal. I'm sure critique will come from many avenues. Many won't believe him.</p>\n<p>B) He failed</p>\n<p>This will be a first for Benny. If he admits it, but I'm sure, lots and lots of people will respond with an &quot;Aha told you so!&quot;.</p>\n<p>Both responses will lead to a negative response in my opinion and I think that's sad. When opened to public scrutiny, especially with such a lofty goal, proving something to others becomes a nasty thing. That's where I think an unfortunate thing occurs, <strong>when you have a product to sell and it's your living, then you have to prove your methods work, otherwise your product fails. </strong>Benny looks like an amazing guy. I'm sure I'd love to sit with with him over a few beers and talk about the world and travelling. But sometimes, like many people, we will disagree about things. I would say that I love learning languages, but I'm a more methodological learner. I love going after the small things. Heck, why will I spend the whole day researching character encoding just 'cause <a title=\"I have a drinking problem\" href=\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/10/drinking-problem/\">I noticed a small change in a character</a>? I'd like to become fluent in a language. He will respond that he also likes to becomes fluent in a language, but in a lot of them. I'm sure we will agree that both sides are good.</p>\n<p>But I'll ask him one final question, Benny, have you ever considered that if you fail in your Mandarin mission, to admit it and learn from your mistakes? Because I believe, someone in your position, can teach us a lot more about learning languages, especially if you have failed, than many other people out there. You have spent many years perfecting your technique, why not now again?</p>\n<p>But then he'll respond, &quot;I might just prove you all wrong&quot;.</p>\n<p>And that ladies and gentlemen is the whole crux of the matter. One can go on and on about learning languages (like I have now!), but sometimes, you can, and I really believe this, achieve a lot in 3 months of learning a language. No, he doesn't have a language gene or a natural talent, it all comes down to pure tenacity of it all. We are all skeptics, and that's good, I'm one of them. Mandarin really is the top of languages to conquer for an English speaking person.</p>\n<p>In the back of my mind I want Benny to fail. I know it sounds bad. But hear me out. If he fails and is willing to accept that Chinese is a tough language and works hard to conquer that failure, we as a Chinese learning community can then constructively help each others to achieve the same goals, whether it's 3 months or 4 years. There is no magic formula to this. Sometimes we wish there was. That's why Benny is great, 'cause he makes us believe that. But sometimes, you get hit with a language like Chinese and all previous conventions gets thrown out the window. That's why I love it. And I hope that's what Benny will find too.</p>\n</div>","amp":"112","plaintext":"[P.S - you are in for big post here! But do read please]\n\nSo, the language learning community is buzzing, especially the Chinese one, with\nthe news that Benny is attempting to become fluent in Mandarin in 3 Months\n[http://www.fluentin3months.com/mandarin-mission/]. Now, phew, where to start on\nthis doozy of a topic. I remember writing about this briefly last year, asking \nHow Long does it take to Learn Chinese?\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/07/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-chinese/] A\nfew others have already posted their thoughts on Benny's mission: Sara Jaaksola\n[http://sarajaaksola.com/becoming-fluent-in-chinese/]  and Olle Linge\n[http://www.hackingchinese.com/?p=1028]. It pretty much echoes what most people\nare saying, that Benny is in over his head, but it's not impossible. Reddit also\nhad a bit of go at Benny\n[http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/o7unk/some_guys_plan_to_speak_fluent_chinese_from/] \n (with him posting there himself).\n\nThere are some topics I'd like to discuss concerning his mission as a language\nlearner, linguist and Chinese enthusiast in response to Benny and lots of others\nthings in terms of language learning.\n\nThe Beginning\nI've been following Benny and other polyglot blogs for some time now. I find\ntheir dedication and admiration for learning languages inspiring. But, I've\nalways had a mixed feeling of disdain, jealously and hope when reading his and\nother people's blogs. On one side, these people rock. The more people are\ninspiring and blogging about languages the better, but sometimes these goals\nthat the polyglots put on themselves becomes pride, and turns into a stubborn\ndefense mechanism.I have found this on a few of these blogs. I remember being\nbanned from commenting on a site for questioning statements\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/11/flashcards-and-second-language-acquisition/].\nThere is a divide between language learners, linguists and bloggers. This is a\ntopic I also talked about in much depth with Benny on his blog post about\nlinguists [http://www.fluentin3months.com/linguists/]. Here in lies the problem.\n\nThe Experience Paradox\nThis can be applied to many things, but this is especially applicable to\nlanguage learning, as it is a very personal subjective experience. Let's take an\nexample here to clarify my problem:Say I have learned Chinese by listening to\nChinese TV all waking hours of my life and then after 4 months start talking\nfluent Mandarin, my method was a success. To me that is. Now if Joe comes to me\nand says, what I say is a wrong way of learning Chinese, because I should have\nlistened to Chinese Music for 3 months, then I'd be more advanced, because this\nis what Joe has done, therefore my approach is invalid.\n\nThe argument is dead from the start. No-one will budge. Subjective experience\nbecomes subjectively true.\n\nNow, when claims are made from a linguistics objective perspective, based on\nresearch, then I hope, this is what has been missing from most polyglot blogs,\nis the tendency to avoid accepting defeat and or altering their \"trusted\"\nmethods due to research and/or suggestions. HOWEVER, it must be added that even\nif the response is not given from objective point of view, then the learner must\nbe willing to explore other methods, or at least accept that other methods might\nwork.\n\nThat's the whole beauty of learning languages. There is no ultimate way of doing\nit. I recommend reading this book/research, about success in learning languages\n[http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/languagelearning/booksbackinprint/successwithforeignlanguages/success.pdf]\n. It covers seven different types of successful language learners. Basically, it\nshows just how different methods and attitudes can achieve the same goal.\n\nThe same way that some people are stubborn in their ways about many things in\nlife, the same way polyglots are (mostly) stubborn about their methods. Having a\npublic blog, opens this up to scrutiny. The motivation to pursue a blog becomes\nsuspicious. It begs the question, if you are learning languages should you also\nnot be willing to learn how to learn languages too? Meta-linguistics skills is\nalso something that I have talked about before when asking the question about\nwhether Chinese is a good first foreign language to learn\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2010/11/is-chinese-a-good-choice-for-your-first-foreign-language/]\n?\n\nRelative difficulty is a real thing\nNow this is something that bothers me the most about some polyglot blogs, is the\nidea that there are no hard languages. Objectively yes, relatively... nope. The\ndifference between languages becomes a hurdle in terms of acquiring that\nlanguage. It is simply there. This phenomenon exists. However, tackling the idea\nof hard/difficult languages becomes two-fold.I have found this many times when\npeople respond to me when I say that I learn Chinese, \"Wow, it must be tough\nlearning the hardest language in the world!\" I usually just play along, and due\nto social etiquette I refrain from rambling linguistic nonsense to prove my\npoint. But the fact remains, that there is a belief that there are objectively\nhard languages. My dad is even a culprit of this. When he sees me writing\nChinese, he goes, \"Why are they still using a primitive writing system?\". We\nneed to distill this belief and let people know that there is relative\ndifficulty in acquiring languages. I can acquire Dutch relatively easy due to my\nAfrikaans background, but learning Mandarin, hell no.\n\nBut, Benny, always points out that there is no such thing as a hard language. I\nhave read his blog and the language hacking guide and I admire the tenacity to\ninstill this idea. It definitely works and helps people overcome the mental\nblock. Anyone can acquire any language. But let's not kid ourselves, some\nlanguages are going to be more difficult than others to acquire. More time needs\nto be invested to achieve the same results. Acceptance of this, need not be a\nstumbling block, but in fact a challenge and more motivation.\n\nI predict a post from Benny that will say that Mandarin is not that hard. He has\nalready posted this idea as a comment on his Youtube vide0.\n\nChinese is so logical in so many ways, and I will be writing a post later to\nENCOURAGE learners who want to take it on, especially comparing it to European\nlanguages. I think it's just so exaggerated to say a European language is\neasier. I can give lots of examples, and will later.\nLike I said, objectively yes, relatively no, not if you're coming from a certain\nlanguage background. Benny however has the meta-linguistic experience to\novercome these differences more readily than others, but the fact remains that, \nit is harder to learn.

I downloaded it and tested it out for a review on my HTC Desire Android phone. First I'll just give an overview of the app, then I'll leave my thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837256/Mandarin-Madness-3_hqkeik.png\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft  wp-image-965\\\" title=\\\"Mandarin-Madness-3\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837256/Mandarin-Madness-3_hqkeik.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"253\\\" height=\\\"381\\\" /></a>\\r\\n<h3 style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Initial Impressions</span></h3>\\r\\nThe art and sound design is consistent and inviting. This often one my biggest gripes when it comes to learning applications in that the creators/developers often overlook the whole package of creating instructional programs. Art and design is definitely something that aids a learner in interacting with the program (or at least not chasing them away!). The pictures are solid and often cutesy, but not in the way that it will put off the alpha-male-Hello-Kitty-hating jock. The sound, although not perfect, serves its function.\\r\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">How it Works</span></h3>\\r\\nThe app has several vocabulary lists, ranging from animals, to colours, to stationery, to clothes and more. Usually about 10-12 different words surrounding a theme. As seen in the screenshot, words come down from the top and you have to choose the correct corresponding picture/icon below before it reaches the bottom, otherwise you lose a life. <strong>They \\\"train\\\" the vocabulary association by starting only with one character</strong> (along with pronunciation which is sounded out as it starts dropping) and one picture. In doing so you know that 狗 is pronounced gǒu and is linked to a dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter each vocabulary item is correctly associated, the level ends. They then add more pictures below (four is the max), from then on levels either become quicker, or they remove either the sound or character, so you can learn both associations. It keeps on speeding up until it reaches level 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next stage is a where the words sort of bounce around in random directions. It does not go straight down like the first stage. Sometimes the characters even turn upside down. The final stage is where you have to arrange the icons at the bottom to correspond to four characters coming down from the top before they reach the bottom.\\r\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Linguistic Approach</span></h3>\\r\\nMandarin Madness is language agnostic. This means that the app is meant to be used by anyone, regardless of native tongue. This means, for someone like me, there's no English anywhere in this app. Associations between sound + character to meaning is mapped by the picture that it provides. <strong>Thus, it's a \\\"natural\\\" approach to word acquisition.</strong> This is not necessarily the better approach, as it depends on the kind of learner. Furthermore, there is little explicit instruction in the app concerning grammar, word structure or any such sorts and thus mainly focuses on vocabulary acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find idea of a language agnostic app quite interesting and actually really cool, but it comes with its disadvantages. It's really hard to help with meaning negotiation when it comes to learning words. <strong>You have to rely on the pictures to explain what the word means. This is really tough and perhaps one of the app's biggest challenges</strong>. Some words work quite easily, like numbers, colors or animals. Objects that are easily defined by a picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, other words, such as Peking Duck, Spring Festival Couplets and Lion Dance (舞狮) in the Chinese culture vocabulary group are hard to understand completely. I have some previous knowledge of Chinese, thus I knew what they meant, but without that, how does one know? Abstract words will be out of the scope for this app.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn uniquely Chinese challenge comes up too. There are other versions of this game for Spanish and English. They work fine, but for Chinese, due to it having no grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence, ie. it doesn't use an alphabet, its harder to understand the pronunciation of Chinese without an idea of how the romanization looks like.<strong> Pinyin (or Zhuyin) serves a function to mediate learning the actual pronunciation, without it, you're kind of lost</strong>, unless you already know it to some extent. New learners would have trouble understanding Chinese pronunciation. There are also no indication of tones, or even the existence of them! Many incorrect inferences will be made by unsuspecting learners.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837254/Mandarin-Madness-7-200x300_ddoavv.png\\\"><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-979 alignleft\\\" title=\\\"Mandarin-Madness-7-200x300\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837254/Mandarin-Madness-7-200x300_ddoavv.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"300\\\" /></a></strong>\\r\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">User Experience and Game Design</span></h3>\\r\\nDue to it being a touch screen app, pressing the icons to select the character is quite easy and fits the style of learning. However, there are some other things in the app that bugs me. Some things that would put me off from using the app completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these is the fact that during a stage, with its increasing difficulty in levels, there is no way to \\\"save\\\" a level once you've passed one, besides actually losing all your lives. <strong>If I want to stop the game and not redo all the previous levels, I have to literally make myself lose.</strong> Just wait for the words to scroll past my screen. Maybe this is an oversight, but it really hampers the flow and accessibility of the app. Due this, the app feels unnecessarily repetitive and chore-like. I can't just quickly play a level while waiting in a queue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, when you choose a wrong word, red crosses cover all the words for a brief second or two. During the higher levels, when the words move down quickly, you can't press the \\\"crossed\\\" out buttons, until the red cross fades away. This makes it almost impossible to correct a mistake at such a high speed and you inevitably lose a life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther factors are due to the language agnostic approach to the app. There are no instructions. Nowhere. This makes it very hard for the user to understand what is going on and what buttons mean. This is where clever user experience design can overcome this hurdle, but it doesn't quite make it, especially on the last stage, where you have align icons to the words that are dropping down. <strong>It took me at least 4 deaths to understand what's going on.</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe I missed this point, but for some reason you get points. There is no indication for what these points are there for, besides just for show.\\r\\n<h3><span style=\\\"text-decoration: underline;\\\">Final Thoughts</span></h3>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://mandarinmadness.com/\\\">Mandarin Madness</a> has definitely some interesting ideas, like the agnostic approach, vocabulary sets and arcade-like gameplay, ones which I feel can be quite beneficial in making a fun interactive learning game on your phone. For now, there are some serious challenges in the usage of the app and some hurdles that need to be jumped before I will recommend this app as a permanent addition to a Chinese learner's, especially beginner learner's smartphone. Some of these hurdles are the disadvantages of a language agnostic approach, user experience hiccups and not addressing the unique properties of Chinese vocabulary.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Language Agnostic\\r\\n+ Fun and interactive\\r\\n+ Great Art\\r\\n- No instructions\\r\\n- User Experience unwelcoming\\r\\n- Does not address unique properties of Chinese vocabulary clearly enough\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>The Chinese language learning technology space in my opinion is still under utilized.

For now, there are some serious challenges in the usage of the app and some hurdles that need to be jumped before I will recommend this app as a permanent addition to a Chinese learner's, especially beginner learner's smartphone.

There are so much more avenues to explore in terms of aiding informal\nand formal learners of Chinese. There has been quite a lot of advances recently\nwith excellent products (3000Hanzi\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/03/introducing-3000hanzi/]  and ChineseLevel\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/02/introducing-chineselevel-test-chinese-reading/]\n) as well as great tools (HanziJS\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/03/introducing-hanzi-character-decomposition-tool/] \n and Leiden Weibo Corpus\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/04/introducing-leiden-weibo-corpus/]) among\nothers in the web space.\n\nThe mobile space is very much an exploratory scene at the moment. There are apps\nsuch Tencent's Intelligent Eye\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/09/tencents-intelligent-eye-appears/]  and\nPleco's Optical Character Recognition, not even mentioning the awesome\ndictionary apps, of which Hanping is my favourite on Android.\n\nMandarin Madness [http://mandarinmadness.com/]  is a relatively new app on the\nscene that aims to make learning Chinese vocabulary easy and fun at the same\ntime. I downloaded it and tested it out for a review on my HTC Desire Android\nphone. First I'll just give an overview of the app, then I'll leave my thoughts.\n\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837256/Mandarin-Madness-3_hqkeik.png]\n\nInitial Impressions\nThe art and sound design is consistent and inviting. This often one my biggest\ngripes when it comes to learning applications in that the creators/developers\noften overlook the whole package of creating instructional programs. Art and\ndesign is definitely something that aids a learner in interacting with the\nprogram (or at least not chasing them away!). The pictures are solid and often\ncutesy, but not in the way that it will put off the\nalpha-male-Hello-Kitty-hating jock. The sound, although not perfect, serves its\nfunction.How it Works\nThe app has several vocabulary lists, ranging from animals, to colours, to\nstationery, to clothes and more. Usually about 10-12 different words surrounding\na theme. As seen in the screenshot, words come down from the top and you have to\nchoose the correct corresponding picture/icon below before it reaches the\nbottom, otherwise you lose a life. They \"train\" the vocabulary association by\nstarting only with one character  (along with pronunciation which is sounded out\nas it starts dropping) and one picture. In doing so you know that 狗 is\npronounced gǒu and is linked to a dog.After each vocabulary item is correctly\nassociated, the level ends. They then add more pictures below (four is the max),\nfrom then on levels either become quicker, or they remove either the sound or\ncharacter, so you can learn both associations. It keeps on speeding up until it\nreaches level 15.\n\nThe next stage is a where the words sort of bounce around in random directions.\nIt does not go straight down like the first stage. Sometimes the characters even\nturn upside down. The final stage is where you have to arrange the icons at the\nbottom to correspond to four characters coming down from the top before they\nreach the bottom.\n\nLinguistic Approach\nMandarin Madness is language agnostic. This means that the app is meant to be\nused by anyone, regardless of native tongue. This means, for someone like me,\nthere's no English anywhere in this app. Associations between sound + character\nto meaning is mapped by the picture that it provides. Thus, it's a \"natural\"\napproach to word acquisition.  This is not necessarily the better approach, as\nit depends on the kind of learner.

The others are pictographs, ideographs and indicatives, which are not discussed below. Semantic-phonetic compounds usually have the semantic radical on the left and the phonetic radical on the right. An example: 洋 (Yáng - Ocean) which has the semantic radical on the left ,氵 (water), and the phonetic radical, 羊 (Yáng), on the right. To see dissections of other characters, use <a href=\\\"http://hanzijs.com\\\">HanziJS</a>.\\r\\n<h3>1) Frequency</h3>\\r\\nFrequency is a complex effect. This refers to both frequency of the character and the frequency of the radical. Higher frequency characters receive less attention in decomposition. Think of it as if you are used to something, that you don't look at the details anymore.

The phonetic radical, usually on the right, thus aids in helping you figure out what the character is.\\r\\n<h3>3) Regularity</h3>\\r\\nRegularity refers to how similar the pronunciation of the phonetic radical and character is. 洋 for instance would be regular. Both the character and phonetic radical (羊) have the exact same pronunciation: Yáng. If a character's pronunciation is regular with the radical's pronunciation, then they are usually named faster and more accurately. Once again, in low frequency characters, the regularity helps a lot in naming of the character.\\r\\n<h3>4) Transparency</h3>\\r\\nTransparency refers to how clearly the semantic radical portrays the meaning of the character.

Paul, himself, is a well-known researcher in second language acquisition and I admire his research.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou'll often come across his name when doing applied linguistic research. For some reason, he is overshadowed by Krashen in the public domain. I'm not comparing the two, but when it comes to language learners establishing a linguistic basis for their learning, I often hear Krashen's name first.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me the four strands of language learning is a succinct balanced approach of looking at language learning. Like I said, I'm not a good language learner, especially when I now look at the four strands and how I easily neglect some aspects. Without further ado, here are the four strands:\\r\\n<h3>1) Meaning-Focused Input (Learning through listening and reading)</h3>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837250/earphones_ur0clu.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053\\\" title=\\\"earphones\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837250/earphones_ur0clu.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"375\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this strand the focus should be on trying to understand, gain knowledge and enjoy what you are listening and reading about. Activities include watching TV shows, movies, extensive reading, listening to radio or music or being a listener in a conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meaning-focused input strand should not be too unfamiliar. This is where Krashen's meaning comprehensible input, or the +1 hypothesis, comes in. This means that when you aim for input, you should try and listen and read materials that are just above just current level, in the sense that \\\"unknown language items [are understood] through context clues and background knowledge\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, for this strand to work well, you need a lot of input, otherwise the gains will be low.\\r\\n<h3>2) Meaning-Focused Output (Learning through speaking and writing)</h3>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837250/mouth_q3hrb8.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1055\\\" title=\\\"mouth\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837250/mouth_q3hrb8.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nTo produce language is an essential part of language learning. This is what most language products sell. \\\"Learn to Speak Chinese Quick!\\\". Speak being the emphasis here. In some sense, this is what most language learners aim for. The ability to have conversations using speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther activities in this strand include keeping a diary, writing notes, blogging, having conversations, giving speeches and/or instructions, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main goal of this strand is trying to get your message across to someone else with language knowledge that is largely familiar to you. This idea is very popular in language teaching and is called communicative language teaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Swain also features here. He is the opposite of Krashen. Swain, put forth the output hypothesis, which in my opinion has some really great points as to the role of producing language. These are:\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2.1) The noticing/triggering function</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you speak or write, you notice what gaps your current language knowledge has. This provides you with essential information you would not easily recognize otherwise. If you don't know how to say a word, or what to say, then you have that gap to solve which might inhibit you trying to get your message across to someone. Another effect that this function has, that now, when doing meaning-focused input, you are more attentive to acquiring these potential gaps that could arise during output.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2.2) The Hypothesis-Testing function</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nProducing output allows you to test a hypothesis and then alter this based on \\\"perceived succes and feedback\\\". It need not be immediate. For instance, websites like <a href=\\\"http://lang-8.com\\\">lang-8</a>, allow you to write and get feedback from native speakers.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>2.3) Metalinguistic (reflective) function</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis functions allows you talk about language using language. For instance reconstructing a text with other learners.\\r\\n<h3>3) Fluency Development</h3>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837249/river_ypvkwm.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056\\\" title=\\\"river\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837249/river_ypvkwm.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"318\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this strand the focus lies on improving fluency in your target language in all four skills: listening, writing, reading and speaking. Materials should all be comfortable to you. The goal is not to learn new items or new language, but to increase your processing of existing skills. Activities include speed reading, listening to material already known to you and repeated retelling.\\r\\n<h3>4) Language-Focused Learning (Deliberate Learning)</h3>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837248/chinesewords_aad86u.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1057\\\" title=\\\"chinesewords\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837248/chinesewords_aad86u.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"333\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final strand is where you explicitly learn language features: grammar, vocabulary, spelling, pronunciation and discourse. This might seem unpopular in today's language learning/teaching fields, but this forms an integral and efficient method to improve your language. Activities include using spaced repetition systems and flashcards and pronunciation and grammar drills.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy research at present falls into this strand. I'm looking at spaced repetition systems and Chinese characters. Research has shown (I'll give the details if anyone wants to know) that deliberate learning of vocabulary is actually stored in a similar fashion to your first language and existing second language vocabulary. In fact, words learned in a deliberate manner are actually retrieved quicker than low frequency second language words. Words learned deliberately, like flashcards, however still need to be later learned in a context, to establish a concrete lexical entry for it. A word does not only have the dictionary definition but also other relationships, such as synonyms, antonyms and collocation etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever deliberate learning can \\\"raise consciousness to help later learning\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this strand, as with the other strands, it should be noted, should be placed in a balanced system. You cannot just focus on vocabulary, or you cannot just listen to input. Each strand, according to Paul Nation, should be dived equally.\\r\\n<h3>Where am I at?</h3>\\r\\nAt present, I'm doing a lot of input and deliberate learning. I need to focus more on output and fluency development to strike a balance. How balanced are your four strands? Do you lack something at present?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know what you think of Nation's Four Strands. I quite like it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPicture credits: <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/cygnus921/2678359760/\\\">[1]</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/liamdunn/2663260978/\\\">[2]</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kittymghee/7214245326/\\\">[3]</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kuyan21/7231355512/\\\">[4]</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcohn/7406420624/\\\">[5]</a>\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>In the pursuit of acquiring a language, there are various methods, techniques, guides and approaches which are often emotionally and personally motivated.

I first got to know of Yoyo Chinese through <a href=\\\"http://laowaichinese.net/yoyo-chinese-my-new-job.htm\\\">Albert's blog post</a> (from LaowaiChinese) who is working there now.

They are priced at various levels on a subscription basis. The month-to-month option is $15.95. You can also request tutoring at additional charges.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">The video content is well organized and you can find your way through the library of videos quite easily.

This interest comes from my research into Chinese orthography and spaced repetition systems for my Master's degree. For instance the effects of <a href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/05/5-ways-chinese-radicals-sub-consciously-trolling/\\\">radicals on sub-conscious level on recall of Chinese characters.</a> One question popped into my head the other day on the ratio between Chinese character knowledge versus Chinese vocabulary knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you might know, most Chinese words are formed with the combination of two characters. So, by obvious deduction, your character knowledge would produce more vocabulary knowledge. For instance, knowing the characters 饭，商 and 店, not only gives you three single character words, but also two more words: 饭店 and 商店.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this beneficial relationship between character knowledge and vocabulary knowledge isn't always that apparent. We don't always learn all the words afforded by all the characters we know. We just don't have the time and resources to check up these relationships. It would also get very interesting once the character knowledge becomes more. It would essentially start getting exponential. Any new character to your knowledge of characters would then have the opportunity to form words with any of the previous ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of curiosity I decided to just play around with the most frequent Chinese characters and see what and how many words are created using them.\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">How it was done</h3>\\r\\nI used some code from <a href=\\\"http://hanzijs.com/\\\">HanziJS</a> to do dictionary lookups using the open source <a href=\\\"http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cc-cedict\\\">CC-CEDICT</a> dictionary. I then used the <a href=\\\"http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/\\\">character frequency list</a> from Junda as a source for the characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing some terrible coding skills I then computed all possible two/three/four character combinations and used those to lookup in the dictionary if such words existed. I also counted the single characters as words themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first I only ran tests with up to max of 2 characters combinations. The lookups went quite quick. Then I increased it to three and four character combinations. It slowed down dramatically especially if you increase the amount of characters. I contemplated only looking at two character combinations, but then I might miss some opportunities for chengyu to appear.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I decided to apply an assumption to reduce the amount lookups：\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>Assumption:</strong> Words with three repetitions of the same character next to each other are discarded. So for example: \\\"得得得x\\\" where 'x' is any other character from the list. I have not encountered words in my four and half years of Chinese study where characters repeat three times. The same can thus be said for 'x得得得'.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that wasn't very efficient. It only removed a few hundred lookups for instance at the 25 character level.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething needed to change. The CC-CEDICT has over 100,000 entries. I did not need to look at all the entries to see if there are possible word combinations. So I manually checked the file and created indexes for each character. For instance all dictionary entries starting with ’的' is very little. Only 11!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reduced the lookup times by a major factor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the curious coders out there, I used Node.js. Also at the end of the post I've added a Google Doc link to all the words per category that was generated along with their meanings.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">I should also note, that the lookups only produce one dictionary entry. For instance, according to CC-CEDICT,<strong id=\\\"internal-source-marker_0.37326906085945666\\\"> </strong>has two dictionary entries. I only chose to stop at one, because I want to equate character knowledge versus possible word combinations, not necessarily all the different meanings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Short Graph Version</h3>\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_1178\\\" align=\\\"aligncenter\\\" width=\\\"614\\\"]<img class=\\\" wp-image-1178\\\" title=\\\"wordchart\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837174/wordchart1_weou3e.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"614\\\" height=\\\"356\\\" /> Amount of characters by frequency and how many words they form.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_1174\\\" align=\\\"aligncenter\\\" width=\\\"614\\\"]<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837175/charactertowordratio_tjrcg0.png\\\"><img class=\\\" wp-image-1174\\\" title=\\\"charactertowordratio\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837175/charactertowordratio_tjrcg0.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"614\\\" height=\\\"356\\\" /></a> Character to word ratio[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\\\"attachment_1180\\\" align=\\\"aligncenter\\\" width=\\\"614\\\"]<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837173/characterswords_srrhzs.png\\\"><img class=\\\" wp-image-1180\\\" title=\\\"characterswords\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837173/characterswords_srrhzs.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"614\\\" height=\\\"356\\\" /></a> Amount of words per amount of characters in a word.[/caption]\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">The Long In-Depth Version</h3>\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">10 Characters</h3>\\r\\n<blockquote>Characters: 的,一,是,不,了,在,人,有,我,他\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Lookups (with assumption): 11,010\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Entries Found: 25\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of Entries Found: 0.23%\\r\\n\\r\\nRatio of characters to words: 1:2.5\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time Before Index: &lt;1min\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time After Index: &lt;1sec</blockquote>\\r\\nI did not expect very interesting results from only 10 characters. Most of the first 10 characters are grammatical characters and pronouns. Some interesting words that came out were 不在了 (to be dead/to have passed away), 我人 (we) &amp; 他人 (another/sb else/other people). The latter two is the first time I've seen 人 used in the same way as 们. Quite cool.<strong><strong>\\r\\n</strong></strong>\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">25 Characters</h3>\\r\\n<blockquote>Characters: 的,一,是,不,了,在,人,有,我,他,这,个,们,中,来,上,大,为,和,国,地,到,以,说,时\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Lookups (with assumption): 406,275\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Entries Found: 106\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of Words Found: 0.026%\\r\\n\\r\\nRatio of characters to words: 1:4.24\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time Before Index: 28min\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time After Index: 8secs</blockquote>\\r\\nImmediately the exponential nature is apparent. We gained a few more words with the increase from 10-25. So the additional 15 characters created 81 more words. The first four character dictionary entries arrived: 中国人大 (China's National People's Congress) &amp; 大有人在 (there are plenty such people). They aren't idioms yet though. <strong><strong>\\r\\n</strong></strong>\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">50 Characters</h3>\\r\\n<blockquote>Characters: 的,一,是,不,了,在,人,有,我,他,这,个,们,中,来,上,大,为,和,国,地,到,以,说,时,要,就,出,会,可,也,你,对,生,能,而,子,那,得,于,着,下,自,之,年,过,发,后,作,里\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Lookups (with assumption): 6,375,050\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Entries Found: 326\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of Words Found: 0.005%\\r\\n\\r\\nRatio of characters to words: 1:6.52\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time Before Index: 7 hours\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time After Index: 1min 30 secs</blockquote>\\r\\nOoh boy. The possible combinations is surely hitting massive proportions now. I did not expect 50 characters to take this long to compute. Luckily the second time around it went by a lot quicker.\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">100 Characters</h3>\\r\\n<blockquote>Characters: 的,一,是,不,了,在,人,有,我,他,这,个,们,中,来,上,大,为,和,国,地,到,以,说,时,要,就,出,会,可,也,你,对,生,能,而,子,那,得,于,着,下,自,之,年,过,发,后,作,里,用,道,行,所,然,家,种,事,成,方,多,经,么,去,法,学,如,都,同,现,当,没,动,面,起,看,定,天,分,还,进,好,小,部,其,些,主,样,理,心,她,本,前,开,但,因,只,从,想,实\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Lookups (with assumption): 101,000,100\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Dictionary Entries Found: 1128\\r\\n\\r\\nPercentage of Words Found: 0.001%\\r\\n\\r\\nRatio of characters to words: 1:11.26\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time Before Index: NA\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Computing Time After Index: 31min</blockquote>\\r\\nThings seemed to have escalated quickly. I did over 101,000,100 (yes, that 100 million!) dictionary lookups. Through some more heuristics of character combinations I could've brought that number down, but I'm not a pro on natural language processing just yet. You'll also need to do quite the analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the big numbers involved. I'm glad we finally crossed the 1000 word mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the ratio of characters to words from 50 to 100 characters went up by 73%. From 25 to 50 that increase was closer to a 53.7% increase. It would be interesting to see this ratio played out across higher ranges (200 characters, 400 characters, 800 characters) to see if there is a similar exponential trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are quite a few four character words that popped up. Here are my favourites: 有人想你 (bless you!), 自我实现 (Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs), 自然而然 (Involuntarily) and 同道中人 (Kindred Spirit).\\r\\n<h3 dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Other Findings</h3>\\r\\nI decided to run further analysis on the 1128 words that were generated with the 100 characters. Here's some interesting stats:\\r\\n<blockquote>Characters that start the most words: 不 (59 words), 大 (47 words) and then surprisingly 自 (30).\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of two character words: 785\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of three character words: 180\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of four character words: 63\\r\\n\\r\\nNew order of character frequency based on only the words generated (highest to lowest): 不,人,大,一,家,有,事,心,来,得,学,中,上,下,自,当,生,理,好,地,分,道,子,行,看,时,天,出,说,国,过,成,年,小,面,要,用,本,对,会,为,法,想,多,动,前,是,方,在,所,作,了,起,样,然,同,发,以,个,没,可,能,开,定,这,着,现,从,主,实,之,去,到,后,部,进,的,而,种,就,如,那,我,只,些,于,里,因,其,经,都,还,和,么,们,你,他,但,也,她</blockquote>\\r\\nIt's interesting to look at the new frequency of the characters. Like, 他, which places among the highest in frequency according to Junda's corpus, which takes a lot of novels and texts into account, is now lowest among the 100 most characters only based on the frequency of vocabulary.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne could almost say that there are two kinds of character frequencies: frequency of occurrence in texts vs frequency of occurrence in vocabulary. I wonder if there are interesting correlations to be made here. Maybe if we one wants to be efficient in learning Chinese characters, one needs to look at both frequencies, because they both can create good angles of approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all have learned 他, 她 and 你 as some of the first characters we encounter. It makes sense. So looking at frequency only isn't the necessarily the best approach, but I think there are definitely interesting ways to use frequency to your advantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike, 不, here above for example. It is high in both frequencies and has created the most words, thus it is awesome character.\\r\\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\\r\\nIt was a fun experiment. Perhaps there are interesting experiments like this to be made. Most of words are obscure though. I'm not sure of their usefulness, like 成说 (accepted theory or formulation), 天年 (Natural Life Span), 心经 (The Heart Sutra) and 地心说 (geocentric theory) among many others.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was curious to see how many words there are actually when one takes the most frequent characters. To think about it, if you know 100 characters, you could potentially know 1128 words. That's kinda cool. Whether that translates to useful words, like I mentioned above, is probably not likely.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it would be really cool to take one's own character knowledge and compute that. Unfortunately, it's hard to get that exact knowledge (perhaps from <a href=\\\"http://ankisrs.net\\\">Anki</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai\\\">Skritter</a>?), but also to do those potential vocabulary lookups past 100 characters can get very very expensive in computation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll see if I can create a little app that looks up character combinations for characters a user manually provides.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyhoo, here is the list of all the words per character category (10, 25, 50 and 100) + all four character combinations: <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkcNHhXsPumKZo5Iy07i8xCIeLqrC04Dh63t1Ylffi4/edit\\\">Google Doc Link</a>. Have fun!\\r\\n\\r\\n<em>EDIT: I got a comment on reddit (and here) from Rob who also did a similar experiment. He used the most frequent characters from Harry Potter up to 6000 characters!

This\ninterest comes from my research into Chinese orthography and spaced repetition\nsystems for my Master's degree. For instance the effects of radicals on\nsub-conscious level on recall of Chinese characters.\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/05/5-ways-chinese-radicals-sub-consciously-trolling/] \n One question popped into my head the other day on the ratio between Chinese\ncharacter knowledge versus Chinese vocabulary knowledge.\n\nAs you might know, most Chinese words are formed with the combination of two\ncharacters. So, by obvious deduction, your character knowledge would produce\nmore vocabulary knowledge. For instance, knowing the characters 饭，商 and 店, not\nonly gives you three single character words, but also two more words: 饭店 and 商店.\n\nNow, this beneficial relationship between character knowledge and vocabulary\nknowledge isn't always that apparent. We don't always learn all the words\nafforded by all the characters we know. We just don't have the time and\nresources to check up these relationships. It would also get very interesting\nonce the character knowledge becomes more. It would essentially start getting\nexponential. Any new character to your knowledge of characters would then have\nthe opportunity to form words with any of the previous ones.\n\nOut of curiosity I decided to just play around with the most frequent Chinese\ncharacters and see what and how many words are created using them.\n\nHow it was done\nI used some code from HanziJS [http://hanzijs.com/]  to do dictionary lookups\nusing the open source CC-CEDICT\n[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cc-cedict]  dictionary. I then\nused the character frequency list\n[http://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/]  from Junda as a source\nfor the characters.Using some terrible coding skills I then computed all\npossible two/three/four character combinations and used those to lookup in the\ndictionary if such words existed. I also counted the single characters as words\nthemselves.\n\nAt first I only ran tests with up to max of 2 characters combinations. The\nlookups went quite quick. Then I increased it to three and four character\ncombinations. It slowed down dramatically especially if you increase the amount\nof characters. I contemplated only looking at two character combinations, but\nthen I might miss some opportunities for chengyu to appear.\n\nSo I decided to apply an assumption to reduce the amount lookups：\n\nAssumption:  Words with three repetitions of the same character next to each\nother are discarded. So for example: \"得得得x\" where 'x' is any other character\nfrom the list. I have not encountered words in my four and half years of Chinese\nstudy where characters repeat three times. The same can thus be said for 'x得得得'.\n\nBut that wasn't very efficient. It only removed a few hundred lookups for\ninstance at the 25 character level.\n\nSomething needed to change. The CC-CEDICT has over 100,000 entries. I did not\nneed to look at all the entries to see if there are possible word combinations.\nSo I manually checked the file and created indexes for each character. For\ninstance all dictionary entries starting with ’的' is very little. Only 11!\n\nThis reduced the lookup times by a major factor.\n\nFor the curious coders out there, I used Node.js. Also at the end of the post\nI've added a Google Doc link to all the words per category that was generated\nalong with their meanings.\n\nI should also note, that the lookups only produce one dictionary entry. For\ninstance, according to CC-CEDICT,has two dictionary entries. I only chose to\nstop at one, because I want to equate character knowledge versus possible word\ncombinations, not necessarily all the different meanings.\n\nThe Short Graph Version\n[caption id=\"attachment_1178\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"614\"]  Amount of\ncharacters by frequency and how many words they form.[/caption][caption\nid=\"attachment_1174\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"614\"] \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837175/charactertowordratio_tjrcg0.png] \n Character to word ratio[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1180\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"614\"] \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837173/characterswords_srrhzs.png] \n Amount of words per amount of characters in a word.[/caption]\n\nThe Long In-Depth Version\n10 Characters\nCharacters: 的,一,是,不,了,在,人,有,我,他Total Dictionary Lookups (with\nassumption): 11,010\n\nTotal Dictionary Entries Found: 25\n\nPercentage of Entries Found: 0.23%\n\nRatio of characters to words: 1:2.5\n\nTotal Computing Time Before Index: <1min\n\nTotal Computing Time After Index: <1sec\n\n\nI did not expect very interesting results from only 10 characters.

I stopped whenever I saw interesting Chinese characters which I haven't encountered before. I started collecting interesting looking characters which had cool stories behind them. Ones that made me go, \\\"Woah that's awesome\\\" or \\\"No way, that's cool\\\". Maybe I'm just obsessed with Chinese characters, but I'm sure you'll find these characters awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img class=\\\"wp-image-1201 alignleft\\\" title=\\\"bow\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837173/bow_caypcy.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"259\\\" height=\\\"511\\\" />\\r\\n<h3>1) 弓 (gōng) - The Bow</h3>\\r\\nThis one is pretty nifty and is immediately apparent. It means “bow\\\".  It is actually one of the 214 Chinese radicals. You can see it in words like 弟弟 or 引 (to pull or to draw a bow).\\r\\n<h3>2) 短 (duǎn) - Short Arrow</h3>\\r\\nGoing with the arrow/bow theme here. This character might seem familiar to some. 短 means \\\"short\\\". I wondered why. The left side of the character has the radical 矢, which means arrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in ancient times the standard to measure something long was to use a 弓 (bow). Now an arrow, which was shorter than a bow, was used to measure something short. Cool hey!\\r\\n<h3>3) 法 (fǎ) - The Law</h3>\\r\\nThis character is an argument for the awesomeness of old characters. 法 simplified comes from an old variant of the character 灋. 灋 is a compound ideogram, meaning it is composed of two (or more) semantic components. The two radicals are, 水 (water) on the left and then 廌 (unicorn) on the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow what does unicorn have to do the with the law?\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to folklore, a unicorn, or a similar mythological animal, would differentiate between right or wrong by touching the wrongdoer with its horn during a case hearing. Awesome.\\r\\n<h3>4) 弋 (yì) - To Shoot</h3>\\r\\nThe old bone script character of <strong id=\\\"internal-source-marker_0.18941454589366913\\\">弋</strong>  represented a small stake, probably where you would hang an animal after a hunt. But now, for me it kind of looks like someone trying to throw a spear. Maybe that's just me. I just like the look of it. You can find it in this old character for instance: 隿, which has <strong id=\\\"internal-source-marker_0.18941454589366913\\\">弋</strong> on the left and 隹 (bird radical) on the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou guessed correctly, to go hunting for birds.\\r\\n<h3>5) 兀 (wù) - Cut off</h3>\\r\\nThis macabre character means to cut off at the feet, but also a few other meanings: to rise to a height and bald. If you look at the character it looks like it can represent all of those meanings.\\r\\n<h3>6) 眊 (mào) - Poor eyesight</h3>\\r\\nI giggled when I saw this character (perhaps like a schoolgirl). It means \\\"to have poor eyesight\\\". According to character dictionaries, this character is a semantic-phonetic compound. The semantic radical means 目 (eye) and on the right 毛 (mao) aids in the pronunciation of the character.

I stopped whenever I saw interesting Chinese characters which I haven't encountered before. I started collecting interesting looking characters which had cool stories behind them.

It means “bow\".  It is actually one of the 214 Chinese radicals. You can see it in words like 弟弟 or 引 (to pull or to draw a bow).\n<h3>2) 短 (duǎn) - Short Arrow</h3>\nGoing with the arrow/bow theme here. This character might seem familiar to some. 短 means \"short\". I wondered why. The left side of the character has the radical 矢, which means arrow.\n<p>Now in ancient times the standard to measure something long was to use a 弓 (bow). Now an arrow, which was shorter than a bow, was used to measure something short. Cool hey!</p>\n<h3>3) 法 (fǎ) - The Law</h3>\nThis character is an argument for the awesomeness of old characters. 法 simplified comes from an old variant of the character 灋. 灋 is a compound ideogram, meaning it is composed of two (or more) semantic components. The two radicals are, 水 (water) on the left and then 廌 (unicorn) on the right.\n<p>Now what does unicorn have to do the with the law?</p>\n<p>According to folklore, a unicorn, or a similar mythological animal, would differentiate between right or wrong by touching the wrongdoer with its horn during a case hearing. Awesome.</p>\n<h3>4) 弋 (yì) - To Shoot</h3>\nThe old bone script character of <strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.18941454589366913\">弋</strong>  represented a small stake, probably where you would hang an animal after a hunt. But now, for me it kind of looks like someone trying to throw a spear. Maybe that's just me. I just like the look of it. You can find it in this old character for instance: 隿, which has <strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.18941454589366913\">弋</strong> on the left and 隹 (bird radical) on the right.\n<p>You guessed correctly, to go hunting for birds.</p>\n<h3>5) 兀 (wù) - Cut off</h3>\nThis macabre character means to cut off at the feet, but also a few other meanings: to rise to a height and bald. If you look at the character it looks like it can represent all of those meanings.\n<h3>6) 眊 (mào) - Poor eyesight</h3>\nI giggled when I saw this character (perhaps like a schoolgirl). It means \"to have poor eyesight\". According to character dictionaries, this character is a semantic-phonetic compound. The semantic radical means 目 (eye) and on the right 毛 (mao) aids in the pronunciation of the character. But I feel like it is also a compound ideogram, because having poor eyesight is like having 毛 (hair) in front of your 目 (eye).\n<p>If you are imagining a guy with long hair having trouble seeing then we are on the same level.

There's no spoilers in here,\nso it's safe to watch. It features Catwoman, Batman and Bane.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no Chinese speaking in it, but there are some Chinese\ncharacters. Check the video first. It's awesome!\n\nEdit: Commenters have corrected my guesses at the Chinese on the signs.  To make\nthis post a little bit cleaner, I'm going to post what I first thought, then the\ncorrections.\n\nCool hey!? 1930's Shanghai, Batman, cool animation. What's not to like?Anyhoo,\ncheck out some of the Chinese characters I snapped from the video. I'm not\nreally sure if they mean anything. I'll need your help.\n\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837170/Screen-Shot-2012-09-04-at-11_43_01-AM_ut1ozo.png]\n\nBane is on a rampage and crashes through some shops. The hanging sign says 躴油,\nlang oil? Any advanced learners care to help? Then there is the shop sign 公司陽\n太天奉. Probably means \"Yang Company\" and then \"Most revered/respected\"? Heck, I'm\nassuming the Chinese they used in this video is real, otherwise I'm going on a\nwild goose chase.Edit 1 (By me): Summer pointed out in the comments that Chinese\nused to be read right to left in reference to the 皮影戏 picture below, which I\ncompletely forgot about. Fail me. I went back and checked this horizontal sign\nagain. I got it wrong too! If you switch it around (read right to left) you\nget 奉天太陽公司 which refers to an old tobacco company.\n[http://oldorientmuseum.com/antique_chinese_tobacco_advertising.html]\n\nEdit 2 (Sheenky's words): In the first scene, the characters are 粮油, which means\nrice and oil, not 躴油. Then the \"公司陽 太天奉\" actually should be the other way\naround, that is 奉天, which in english is Fengtian Sun Company. Because in ancient\nChina, people used to read and write character from right to left. 奉天 is a name\nof a place in China. I have googled the 奉天太陽公司 which there's no results matched.\nBut there is an old company named 奉天太陽煙公司 which is what you've mentioned as an\nold tobacco company. But in the movie scene, I don't think that's exactly the\ntobacco. I think 奉天太陽公司 is just a general company which sells rice and oil.\n\nThe sign to the left says 杜家者 (dù jiā zhě). Another blank here. The 者 suffix\nusually is a suffix a type of person doing something. Like an author is 作者.\n\nEdit 1 (Sheenky's words): About the 杜家者, actually it should be 杜家老铺 which you\ncan get it only if you watch the scene very carefully. 杜家老铺 which means an old\nshop with an owner surnamed Du, in English it's just like Du's.\n\n\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837168/Screen-Shot-2012-09-04-at-11_44_55-AM_jdagua.png]\n\nNow this one I know! 城管 (chéngguǎn). If you read a bit of Chinese news, you'll\nnotice 城管 come up quite a lot. Their like a local law enforcement group and\noften cause trouble. They're not very well liked. \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837167/Screen-Shot-2012-09-04-at-11_49_05-AM_bkpkid.png]\n\nNow this scene I thought was particularly clever.

It is also called a spaced repetition system.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, after each flashcard you respond by saying how well your remembered the word. If you remember it well, the program schedules the review of the flashcard further away (say three days). However, if you didn't remember it too well, then it spaces the review closer (say 1 day).\\r\\n\\r\\nThese intervals become greater the better you remember the words, so there's no need to learn words you've already learned!\\r\\n<h2>2) Skritter</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837597/skritter_wmbe6p.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-384\\\" title=\\\"skritter\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837597/skritter_wmbe6p.jpg\\\" width=\\\"339\\\" height=\\\"349\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai\\\">Skritter</a> is a website that also takes spaced repetition systems into account, but rather helps you learn <strong>how to write </strong>Chinese characters by using a clever character recognition system they have built. You can use your mouse, trackpad &amp; graphic tablet to write these characters, but the best way is to their <a href=\\\"http://www.skritter.com/ios\\\">iPhone &amp; iPad apps</a> that have launched recently.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've been lax in my Skrittering as I need to save money for the end of the year (I will reveal why later this year), but also because I seriously yearn for an iOS device. It's like a match made in heaven &amp; why settle for less? :)\\r\\n<h2>3) MDBG</h2>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837604/mdbg_bgtbzz.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-96\\\" title=\\\"mdbg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837604/mdbg_bgtbzz.jpg\\\" width=\\\"482\\\" height=\\\"161\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://mdbg.net\\\">MDBG</a> is one of the first online dictionaries that I used. They segment any sentence or paragraph into words so it's easier to understood. When I started learning Chinese, this was a god-send. The dictionary that they use, CC-CEDICT, is one that they maintain and is open-source, so it is probably the most up-to-date dictionary out there.\\r\\n<h2>4) Jukuu &amp; iChaCha</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837104/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-11_19_23-AM_je9agi.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1277\\\" title=\\\"Jukuu\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837104/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-11_19_23-AM_je9agi.png\\\" width=\\\"461\\\" height=\\\"252\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nNow, however, being at the intermediate level, I have shifted my dictionary lookups to sites like <a href=\\\"http://jukuu.com\\\">Jukuu</a> &amp; <a href=\\\"http://ichacha.net\\\">iChaCha</a>. The reason why I post both sites, is because they serve the same function. They act as context \\\"helpers\\\" if I can call it that. Whenever I find a new word, or I'm not sure exactly how to use a word or where it is placed in a sentence, I search using Jukuu &amp; iChaCha.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of example this to explain. I got asked what the translation for optimism is. Now the true direct dictionary translation would be 乐观主义, where the -主义 is a suffix in Mandarin denoting \\\"-ism\\\". 乐观 on its own means \\\"optimistic\\\". I've always been weary about suffixes in Chinese, so I <a href=\\\"http://jukuu.com/search.php?q=optimism\\\">went to Jukuu</a> to just check if they use optimism with the -主义 when speaking about someone's optimism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt turns that my suspicion was indeed correct. 乐观, although directly translated as \\\"optimistic\\\" can be used to say 他的乐观 to refer to his optimism. In English it would sound weird, \\\"His optimistic\\\", but this just shows that word boundaries aren't always what they seem.\\r\\n\\r\\nJukuu &amp; iChaCha are increasingly my favourite tools in my Chinese learning escapade.\\r\\n<h2>5) Zhongwen Pop-up Dictionary</h2>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837104/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-11_21_15-AM_nmnaik.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1278\\\" title=\\\"Zhongwen\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837104/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-11_21_15-AM_nmnaik.png\\\" width=\\\"382\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" /></a>\\r\\n\\r\\nThis little tool has made many walls of Chinese text bearable. It is an addon/extension for <a href=\\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde\\\">Chrome</a> &amp; <a href=\\\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/zhong-wen/\\\">Firefox</a>. Whenever you hover over any Chinese text it instantly pops up with a definition and pronunciation. It works surprisingly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am however considering to slow down my dependency on this tool, as I can very easily become lazy using this. Be careful when using a pop-up dictionary. Use it only when you really need to. With great power comes great responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also try <a href=\\\"http://www.perapera.org/plugins/\\\">Perapera</a>, which is basically the same, but with other stylings. Both work perfectly well.\\r\\n<h2>6) 3000Hanzi</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837103/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-10_31_27-AM_uc79ec.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1279\\\" title=\\\"3000Hanzi\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837103/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-10_31_27-AM_uc79ec.png\\\" width=\\\"454\\\" height=\\\"303\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\n<a href=\\\"http://3000hanzi.com\\\">3000Hanzi</a> is a Chinese reader. It is meant to aid you in reading Chinese by providing dictionaries, word lists &amp; text analysis. This tool is extremely beneficial if you want to improve your Chinese reading. I do not use 3000Hanzi as much as I want to, but I definitely recognize the importance of such a tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a free version with similar idea out there called <a href=\\\"http://lwt.sourceforge.net/\\\">Learning with Texts</a>, but it's a lot harder &amp; confusing to set up. 3000Hanzi also focuses on Chinese specifically, which adds towards the tool.\\r\\n<h2>7) Hanping &amp; Pleco</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837102/hanping_yhsfc4.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"wp-image-1280\\\" title=\\\"hanping\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837102/hanping_yhsfc4.jpg\\\" width=\\\"288\\\" height=\\\"512\\\" /><img class=\\\"size-full wp-image-1282\\\" title=\\\"hanping2\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837101/hanping2_uuzkaf.jpg\\\" width=\\\"288\\\" height=\\\"512\\\" />\\r\\n</a></p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">Another group of tools.

I would recommend <a href=\\\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=embermitre\\\">Hanping for Android</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.pleco.com/\\\">Pleco for iOS</a>. These are also one of those immensely useful tools. When I was <a title=\\\"China Round 2: My Language Experience\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2011/07/china-2-language-experience/\\\">travelling in China last year</a>, Hanping became my Bible.

Anything obvious I missed?</p>\n<p>I'll be doing another list in the future that will list the best content websites for learners.</p>\n</div>","amp":"154","plaintext":"Back when I was undergraduate student, I was still clueless to all the amazing\nproducts available to help complement my Chinese studies. I experienced this\nagain, when I did an experiment with the first year learners of Chinese at my\nUniversity. Many had questions for me and I realized, that I was that same guy.\nNow, with a few more years of discovering the best content, here are essential\ndigital tools for Chinese learners. These are not multimedia content (like\npodcasts or videos), but tools to help with learning.\n\n1) Anki\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837166/Screen-Shot-2012-05-16-at-3_33_19-PM_bjtj06.png]\n\nThis is without a doubt the biggest time-saver out there. Anki\n[http://ankisrs.net]  is a free flashcard program, that helps you to efficiently\norganize the repetitions of words. It is also called a spaced repetition\nsystem.Basically, after each flashcard you respond by saying how well your\nremembered the word. If you remember it well, the program schedules the review\nof the flashcard further away (say three days). However, if you didn't remember\nit too well, then it spaces the review closer (say 1 day).\n\nThese intervals become greater the better you remember the words, so there's no\nneed to learn words you've already learned!\n\n2) Skritter\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837597/skritter_wmbe6p.jpg]\n\nSkritter [http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai]  is a website that\nalso takes spaced repetition systems into account, but rather helps you learn \nhow to writeChinese characters by using a clever character recognition system\nthey have built. You can use your mouse, trackpad & graphic tablet to write\nthese characters, but the best way is to their iPhone & iPad apps\n[http://www.skritter.com/ios]  that have launched recently.I've been lax in my\nSkrittering as I need to save money for the end of the year (I will reveal why\nlater this year), but also because I seriously yearn for an iOS device. It's\nlike a match made in heaven & why settle for less? :)\n\n3) MDBG\n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837604/mdbg_bgtbzz.jpg]\nMDBG [http://mdbg.net]  is one of the first online dictionaries that I used.\nThey segment any sentence or paragraph into words so it's easier to understood.\nWhen I started learning Chinese, this was a god-send. The dictionary that they\nuse, CC-CEDICT, is one that they maintain and is open-source, so it is probably\nthe most up-to-date dictionary out there.\n\n4) Jukuu & iChaCha\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837104/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-11_19_23-AM_je9agi.png]\n\nNow, however, being at the intermediate level, I have shifted my dictionary\nlookups to sites like Jukuu [http://jukuu.com]  & iChaCha [http://ichacha.net].\nThe reason why I post both sites, is because they serve the same function. They\nact as context \"helpers\" if I can call it that. Whenever I find a new word, or\nI'm not sure exactly how to use a word or where it is placed in a sentence, I\nsearch using Jukuu & iChaCha.One of example this to explain. I got asked what\nthe translation for optimism is. Now the true direct dictionary translation\nwould be 乐观主义, where the -主义 is a suffix in Mandarin denoting \"-ism\". 乐观 on its\nown means \"optimistic\". I've always been weary about suffixes in Chinese, so I \nwent to Jukuu [http://jukuu.com/search.php?q=optimism]  to just check if they\nuse optimism with the -主义 when speaking about someone's optimism.\n\nIt turns that my suspicion was indeed correct. 乐观, although directly translated\nas \"optimistic\" can be used to say 他的乐观 to refer to his optimism. In English it\nwould sound weird, \"His optimistic\", but this just shows that word boundaries\naren't always what they seem.\n\nJukuu & iChaCha are increasingly my favourite tools in my Chinese learning\nescapade.\n\n5) Zhongwen Pop-up Dictionary\n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837104/Screen-Shot-2012-09-27-at-11_21_15-AM_nmnaik.png]\nThis little tool has made many walls of Chinese text bearable.

Use it\nonly when you really need to. With great power comes great responsibility.\n\nYou can also try Perapera [http://www.perapera.org/plugins/], which is basically\nthe same, but with other stylings.

I headed on\nover and found an interesting topic\n[http://www.skritter.com/forum/topic?id=222399262]. Is there a list of radicals\nsorted by their first occurrence in HSK? So, basically, show the components\nbased on their entry into an HSK level. I decided to spend the day and code this\nup using code from HanziJS [http://hanzijs.com]. It was interesting question and\nI was curious myself.\n\nDetails\nI used the characters I got from Nciku's list\n[http://blog.nciku.com/blog/en/2011/03/09/hsk-character-list-and-stroke-order-animations/]\n. These characters also seemed to be organized by frequency on each level. I\nthen used HanziJS's radical decomposition code and got all the radicals in each\ncharacter. I then ran each characters components and found the first unique\noccurrence of each component and noted the level of HSK it occurred in and which\ncharacter it was found in. With this list of unique components I then compiled\nthis list of radicals based on the KangXi list\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kangxi_radicals]. The data was not\nentirely consistent, as I found some bugs in the decomposition data, but I\nedited the rest of the code by hand.Here's how the list works:\n\nNr of radical according to Kangxi Radical list: HSK Level, First Character\nOccurrence (additional information)\nThe additional information is where I listed findings based on bound radicals\nand simplified forms. This is especially true for some of the \"not found\"\ncomponents where most are traditional forms. You won't find them in HSK's six\nlevels.Here's the list.

In HSK it appears in 蓄 (xù) which means \\\"to store up\\\", which it makes sense to have the 田 (field) radical there. If you remove the 艹 radical at the top you get another character,畜 (xù), which means \\\"to raise animals\\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice how both characters are pronounced the same: xù\\r\\n\\r\\n玄 doesn't act here as a semantic radical, <strong>but rather a phonetic clue to pronunciation</strong>. I decided to find some more characters that has 玄 in it. Here's what I found:\\r\\n\\r\\n弦昡泫炫牽玅玆玈玹眩舷蚿衒铉\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice something? 玄 mostly occurs on the right. This an indication that it acts as a phonetic radical, providing pronunciation information in semantic-phonetic compounds. <strong>Only three characters seem to use 玄 as a semantic radical:</strong> 玅玆玈, of which one is just a variant of 妙 in 玄妙.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look at the pronunciation of the other characters you get this:\\r\\n\\r\\n弦 (xián), 昡 (xuàn), 泫 (xuàn), 炫 (xuàn), 牽 (qiān), 玹 (xuán), 眩 (xuàn), 舷 (xián), 蚿 (xián),铉 (xuàn)\\r\\n\\r\\nSee the trend there? 玄 most definitely acts as a phonetic radical, rather than a semantic radical. It's kinda disappointing that it isn't used a semantic radical more often, 'cause it definitely has interesting meaning.\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\r\\nI find it strange that 玄 is actually included in the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kangxi_radicals\\\">list of Kangxi radicals</a> in the first place. The list of 214 radicals are semantic radicals. Phonetic radicals, by definition, are not included in this list.<strong> 玄 definitely lives up to its definition. </strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nOddly enough, there's another word that uses 玄: 玄乎, which means \\\"unreliable\\\". 玄 is definitely that, totally unreliable as a semantic radical, but at least works as a neat phonetic radical.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>After running a script last month to see where the first occurrence of a <a title=\"Radicals sorted by their first occurrence in HSK\" href=\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/10/radicals-sorted-occurrence-hsk/\">radicals appear in HSK</a>, there were some interesting observations.

I was instantly intrigued, as it was a novel concept, using blocks with Chinese characters on them with augmented reality. I'm definitely a promoter for new and exciting ways to learn languages, especially when it comes to using new technology. Augmented reality has been buzzing for the past two years, especially in mobile phones. I was curious how they will implement this with Chinese characters, so I got sent a copy to review. Here's a short video provided by them on what it's about.\\r\\n<div align=\\\"center\\\"><iframe src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uEaGBSQUvCc\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\"></iframe></div>\\r\\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837098/IMG_20121106_093354_x5ujes.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1353\\\" title=\\\"ChineseCUBES Lot\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837098/IMG_20121106_093354_x5ujes.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"553\\\" height=\\\"415\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nThe first thing I noticed the <strong>amazing packaging and product design that went into ChineseCUBES</strong>. It's not some cheap product shoved into a box, but it actually has a solid build and design. This gives off a very good first impression. You don't get this in language learning products very often. When I opened it, there was a lot more than I expected: manuals, cd's, whiteboard marker, character cardboard square (for writing on), a rectangle black pad to put the cubes on as well as a webcam.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>The addition of the webcam was quite surprising</strong>. I expected just to use my own webcam, but then I realized, some computers, mostly desktops, do not have webcams, so it was a needed addition.\\r\\n<h2>The Hardware</h2>\\r\\nNow this is cool part of ChineseCUBES. I'm used to doing most of Chinese learning online, <strong>so actually having physical objects present is a welcome change</strong>. It's not just a book or CD, but webcams, cubes and pads. The webcam was a bit strange to figure out (I don't think I've ever used a standalone webcam before). It magnetizes to the stand. At first I thought it might topple over easily, but it manages to hold quite nicely.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837097/IMG_20121106_123137_gub4wf.jpg\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1355\\\" title=\\\"ChineseCUBES\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837097/IMG_20121106_123137_gub4wf.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"614\\\" height=\\\"461\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nThe cubes themselves are also <strong>sturdy and lighter than I expected</strong>. It's hard to guess an appropriate size for the cubes, as there hasn't been a product like this before. In any case, they don't fall around and are not too clunky. <strong>The vast of amount cubes however becomes a bit confusing when you have them all on your table.</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writing pen and square works fine with nothing really special.\\r\\n<h2>The Software</h2>\\r\\nWhen it came to installing the software to use with the webcam, <strong>the process was a little convoluted</strong>. You had to install it via cd, which itself is a strange choice, as CDs are being phased out in new MacBooks and ultrabooks. I would rather have it been on cute cube USB stick than a CD.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen after installation you have register for an account on their website. With that account you can login using the software. I had some trouble with logging in once I created an account, because they asked me enter an \\\"ID\\\" with a password. I thought it was my username. <strong>After a few failed attempts, I realized they wanted my email address instead.</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter logging in you enter your serial number written on the CD case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy can't I just open the program and enter the serial number? What's the point of having an account? Maybe there's a reason for this. In any case after the installation, everything worked perfectly fine.\\r\\n<h2>Using ChineseCUBES</h2>\\r\\n<div align=\\\"center\\\"><iframe src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4ygYDhs7OAw\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\"></iframe></div>\\r\\nHere's the cool part. The webcam picks up the augmented reality tags on one side of the cube. <strong>On your screen the character pops up. </strong>When I first got the product I was skeptical that the augmented reality would be slow or iffy,<strong> but it works surprisingly well and is very responsive. </strong>Most of the time you would only have 1-4 cubes present on the screen, but I tested it with 15 stacked on each other. Every cube gets picked up and there's no lag or crashing present.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837096/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_35_37-PM_ovvykb.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1358\\\" title=\\\"StressTest\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837096/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_35_37-PM_ovvykb.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"562\\\" height=\\\"534\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nThe software has two modes:<strong> Learning &amp; Freestyle</strong>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Freestyle mode, you get to just play around with the cubes. There are 40 character cubes available and then 5 Tutor cubes. The tutor cubes is a great addition to the characters, because they activate an action on the present cube. The present cube is the last cube added to the webcam. So for instance, <strong>when I place the Speak Tutor Cube, the program pronounces that cube and changes the character to Pinyin. </strong>A little avatar also pops up.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837095/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_43_44-PM_jlmlzw.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1360\\\" title=\\\"Speak Tutor Cube\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837095/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_43_44-PM_jlmlzw.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"534\\\" height=\\\"494\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nYou also get a Write Tutor Cube, which shows you how to write it, strokes and all. <strong>You can then use your marker and square cardboard grid to practice.</strong> Wipe it clean afterwards. Quite nifty! Then there's the translation cube, copy cube and Fang Fang. The translation one is self-explanatory, but the copy one is awesome.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>When you place the copy cube next to a character it copies that character.</strong> So now you can write 谢谢 for instance.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837094/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_51_55-PM_fvhs7a.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1362\\\" title=\\\"Copy Cube\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837094/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_51_55-PM_fvhs7a.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"541\\\" height=\\\"513\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nThe Fang Fang cube is still a mystery to me. An avatar just pops up.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow here's the cool thing. When you start putting random cubes together, the program starts suggesting words for you on the right side of the screen.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837093/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-4_25_00-PM_tseuza.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1366\\\" title=\\\"Word Suggestion\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837093/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-4_25_00-PM_tseuza.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"544\\\" height=\\\"469\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nIf you do form a word, it connects the bubbles together. Just thrown down the speech cube, or translation cube for more info. <strong>It's extremely fun. Like a puzzle mixed with exploration.</strong> With 40 characters there are quite a few combinations to keep you busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow for Learning Mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img class=\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-1367\\\" title=\\\"Screen Shot 2012-11-06 at 11.09.22 AM\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837092/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-11_09_22-AM_tv6zlo.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"350\\\" height=\\\"293\\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mode was a bit disappointing. It takes you on a step-by-step tutorial of each theme; that is the good part. It really explains why certain characters were grouped together in a theme. <strong>You end up using all of them in learning one \\\"theme\\\" of 10 characters.</strong> The guidance is great and the pop-up tips by Fang Fang (the main avatar/tutor) is good.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, they add these challenges to Learning Mode, which is basically just a Memory Match game. <strong>This feels pointless to me and definitely not a good way to test your knowledge. </strong>For some people this might seem nice and \\\"game\\\"-like, but it's old and boring for me. I just end up clicking things until they match. There's no skill and very little memory involved.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837091/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-11_29_57-AM_sfslse.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1369\\\" title=\\\"Memory Game\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837091/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-11_29_57-AM_sfslse.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"542\\\" height=\\\"434\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\nWhere the design in Freestyle Mode wasn't really a big focus,<strong> the design in Learning Mode fell flat</strong>. It looked outdated, unpolished and unwelcoming. For example, see the challenge screen above. When you win a \\\"coin\\\", there's this terrible overly-flashy animation that's played.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of a \\\"theme\\\" another type of challenge occurs, where a stimulus is given, such as a sound of word, characters or the pinyin. <strong>You have to choose appropriate answer when the carousel comes around. This again, is terrible user-experience design. </strong>When I look at the answer I sometimes take a split second too long. I then have to wait until the answer comes around again. Urgh.\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><a href=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837090/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-11_32_51-AM_a7oqsj.png\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter  wp-image-1372\\\" title=\\\"Carousel\\\" src=\\\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837090/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-11_32_51-AM_a7oqsj.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"544\\\" height=\\\"465\\\" /></a></p>\\r\\n<strong>The content of the Learning Mode is great, but it's presentation is not on-par with the rest of the product. </strong>The challenges can definitely be improved.\\r\\n<h2>Choice of Characters</h2>\\r\\nStarting Chinese, the question comes to mind, where do I start? ChineseCUBES present 40 character choices. I ran the list of characters through the <a title=\\\"What do you know if you learned the most frequent Chinese characters?\\\" href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/08/learned-frequent-chinese-characters/\\\">same experiment</a> I did a few months back. Here's what I got:\\r\\n<blockquote>Possible Word Combinations: 112\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter List: 我是见很吗不好谢在你谁什她么的也这他那们对去家怎做起哪想里在先太姐请名问生小叫字</blockquote>\\r\\nNot all those words can be formed by the system, for instance words like: 做小 and 起见. However, ChineseCUBES doesn't only work on dictionary entries. It recommended quite a few phrase like structures, such as 我是 and 好小 for instance.<strong> I'm extremely curious how they do this.</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's hard to say if the choice of 40 characters are the best option, but what definitely makes it worth it, are the themes they created around each group of ten.\\r\\n<h2>Overall Impression</h2>\\r\\nOne of the questions I wanted to answer by using this product, was whether the augmented reality was just a gimmick or really added value? This is a hard question to answer as there aren't really a lot of these products available. But here's my opinion on this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the augmented reality does add value. <strong>The visceral connection between the cubes and your screen is something that is hard to explain</strong>. I thought, of taking away the screen and just having the cubes, then I realized, they are pretty useless. The fact that the augmented reality adapts to your interactions, especially with word suggestions in Freestyle mode, definitely enhances the interaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you just had the cubes, then there would not suggestions, no stroke order demonstrations, no instant popups and more. <strong>Thus, the augmented reality does add value. </strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nCould this experience have been replicated by just an online interface? Maybe, but having the actual cubes in your hands and playing with it, is something that cannot be replicated.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>I think the Learning Mode though fails in this added value</strong>: the physical cubes and augmented reality, could easily have been replaced by a tutor-like system explaining the characters and their combos. However, the idea of \\\"themes\\\" around 10 characters, is clever way introducing characters and their relationships to vocabulary/phrase formation in Chinese.\\r\\n<h2>The Learning Value</h2>\\r\\nIt's a pity that I could not have tried ChineseCUBES when I started learning Chinese. This would have allowed to place the review in context of its learning value. However, <strong>I think ChineseCUBES is a novel approach to teaching you your first 40 characters. </strong>The Chinese script is unique and the cubes translate this quite well, especially the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language\\\">isolating morphology</a>.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaying with the cubes in Freestyle mode promotes curiosity and an understanding of how Chinese works.<strong> </strong>This is perhaps the biggest value that ChineseCUBES provide. I'm not sure how well you would be able to remember each word, or start using them in conversations, but <strong>it teaches the learner a unique meta-linguistic skill about the language itself, which I haven't seen before. </strong>\\r\\n\\r\\nOddly lacking is an introduction to radicals? Or their purpose as well. Therefore, ChineseCUBES, function more from the character-level up towards words and then phrase level.\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\r\\nWith a price of $149, it is a little bit on the steep side, but ChineseCUBES is a very unique learning product. An iPad app would not be a replacement. The Freestyle Mode is really something else, that can really just exist with Chinese and the way ChineseCUBES implemented it. The Learning Mode falls flat, but the content itself is not bad and quite novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginner learners and Elementary learners would definitely benefit out of ChineseCUBES. Here's the thing though, ChineseCUBES is not the most efficient and effective product out there. <a href=\\\"http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai\\\">Skritter</a>, <a href=\\\"http://ankisrs.net\\\">Anki</a> and other methods are definitely better, but <strong>ChineseCUBES fills a weird a gap between having fun, self-exploration, learning and introducing the learner to the unique aspects of Chinese syntax and vocabulary/phrase formation</strong>, which is definitely something that needs to be learned.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would recommend this to people just starting out in Chinese, while using other methods. Spend 10-20min a day with ChineseCUBES in Freestyle mode, and you'll learn a lot of the way the language is structured while picking up new vocabulary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that being said,<strong> <a href=\\\"http://chinesecubes.com\\\">ChineseCUBES</a> is not a product that you need to use</strong>, as it does not easily fit in to <a href=\\\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/06/four-strands-language-learning/\\\">the four strands of language learning</a>. It's a not a sustainable product, such as <a href=\\\"http://fluentu.com\\\">FluentU</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai\\\">Skritter</a> that can easily fall into a language learning strand, to keep improving skills. ChineseCUBES, however, might fall into a strand of its own, which I discovered the other day on <a href=\\\"http://leakygrammar.net/2012/10/14/bobby-mcferrin-improvisation-and-language-learning/\\\">Leaky Grammar</a>, called improvisation in language.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt allows you to explore the language and improvise using the Freestyle mode, without any care or rigid rules to stop you.<strong> It's unique and very engaging</strong>.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're frustrated and need a refreshing way to start learning Chinese, then ChineseCUBES will hopefully makes things a bit more clearer.\\r\\n\\r\\n<strong>In summary:</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Novel use of Augmented Reality\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Helps you learn the unique features of the Chinese language.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ Freestyle mode and their recommendations is a great way to explore and start with the Chinese language.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Not necessarily very efficient or effective\\r\\n\\r\\n- Learning Mode, although great in content, fails in presentation\\r\\n\\r\\n- Slightly pricey\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<div class=\"kg-card-markdown\"><p>I received an email a few months back about a new product called <a href=\"http://chinesecubes.com\">ChineseCUBES</a>.

At first I thought it might topple over easily, but it manages to hold quite nicely.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837097/IMG_20121106_123137_gub4wf.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1355\" title=\"ChineseCUBES\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837097/IMG_20121106_123137_gub4wf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"461\" /></a></p>\nThe cubes themselves are also <strong>sturdy and lighter than I expected</strong>. It's hard to guess an appropriate size for the cubes, as there hasn't been a product like this before. In any case, they don't fall around and are not too clunky. <strong>The vast of amount cubes however becomes a bit confusing when you have them all on your table.</strong>\n<p>The writing pen and square works fine with nothing really special.</p>\n<h2>The Software</h2>\nWhen it came to installing the software to use with the webcam, <strong>the process was a little convoluted</strong>. You had to install it via cd, which itself is a strange choice, as CDs are being phased out in new MacBooks and ultrabooks. I would rather have it been on cute cube USB stick than a CD.\n<p>Then after installation you have register for an account on their website. With that account you can login using the software. I had some trouble with logging in once I created an account, because they asked me enter an &quot;ID&quot; with a password. I thought it was my username. <strong>After a few failed attempts, I realized they wanted my email address instead.</strong></p>\n<p>After logging in you enter your serial number written on the CD case.</p>\n<p>Why can't I just open the program and enter the serial number? What's the point of having an account? Maybe there's a reason for this. In any case after the installation, everything worked perfectly fine.</p>\n<h2>Using ChineseCUBES</h2>\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4ygYDhs7OAw\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe></div>\nHere's the cool part. The webcam picks up the augmented reality tags on one side of the cube. <strong>On your screen the character pops up. </strong>When I first got the product I was skeptical that the augmented reality would be slow or iffy,<strong> but it works surprisingly well and is very responsive. </strong>Most of the time you would only have 1-4 cubes present on the screen, but I tested it with 15 stacked on each other. Every cube gets picked up and there's no lag or crashing present.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837096/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_35_37-PM_ovvykb.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1358\" title=\"StressTest\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837096/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_35_37-PM_ovvykb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"534\" /></a></p>\nThe software has two modes:<strong> Learning &amp; Freestyle</strong>.\n<p>In Freestyle mode, you get to just play around with the cubes. There are 40 character cubes available and then 5 Tutor cubes. The tutor cubes is a great addition to the characters, because they activate an action on the present cube. The present cube is the last cube added to the webcam. So for instance, <strong>when I place the Speak Tutor Cube, the program pronounces that cube and changes the character to Pinyin. </strong>A little avatar also pops up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837095/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_43_44-PM_jlmlzw.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-1360\" title=\"Speak Tutor Cube\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837095/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-2_43_44-PM_jlmlzw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"534\" height=\"494\" /></a></p>\nYou also get a Write Tutor Cube, which shows you how to write it, strokes and all. <strong>You can then use your marker and square cardboard grid to practice.</strong> Wipe it clean afterwards.

ChineseCUBES present 40 character choices. I ran the list of characters through the <a title=\"What do you know if you learned the most frequent Chinese characters?\" href=\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/08/learned-frequent-chinese-characters/\">same experiment</a> I did a few months back. Here's what I got:\n<blockquote>Possible Word Combinations: 112\n<p>Character List: 我是见很吗不好谢在你谁什她么的也这他那们对去家怎做起哪想里在先太姐请名问生小叫字</blockquote><br>\nNot all those words can be formed by the system, for instance words like: 做小 and 起见. However, ChineseCUBES doesn't only work on dictionary entries. It recommended quite a few phrase like structures, such as 我是 and 好小 for instance.<strong> I'm extremely curious how they do this.</strong></p>\n<p>It's hard to say if the choice of 40 characters are the best option, but what definitely makes it worth it, are the themes they created around each group of ten.</p>\n<h2>Overall Impression</h2>\nOne of the questions I wanted to answer by using this product, was whether the augmented reality was just a gimmick or really added value? This is a hard question to answer as there aren't really a lot of these products available. But here's my opinion on this.\n<p>I think the augmented reality does add value. <strong>The visceral connection between the cubes and your screen is something that is hard to explain</strong>. I thought, of taking away the screen and just having the cubes, then I realized, they are pretty useless. The fact that the augmented reality adapts to your interactions, especially with word suggestions in Freestyle mode, definitely enhances the interaction.</p>\n<p>If you just had the cubes, then there would not suggestions, no stroke order demonstrations, no instant popups and more. <strong>Thus, the augmented reality does add value. </strong></p>\n<p>Could this experience have been replicated by just an online interface? Maybe, but having the actual cubes in your hands and playing with it, is something that cannot be replicated.</p>\n<p><strong>I think the Learning Mode though fails in this added value</strong>: the physical cubes and augmented reality, could easily have been replaced by a tutor-like system explaining the characters and their combos. However, the idea of &quot;themes&quot; around 10 characters, is clever way introducing characters and their relationships to vocabulary/phrase formation in Chinese.</p>\n<h2>The Learning Value</h2>\nIt's a pity that I could not have tried ChineseCUBES when I started learning Chinese. This would have allowed to place the review in context of its learning value. However, <strong>I think ChineseCUBES is a novel approach to teaching you your first 40 characters. </strong>The Chinese script is unique and the cubes translate this quite well, especially the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language\">isolating morphology</a>.\n<p>Playing with the cubes in Freestyle mode promotes curiosity and an understanding of how Chinese works.<strong> </strong>This is perhaps the biggest value that ChineseCUBES provide. I'm not sure how well you would be able to remember each word, or start using them in conversations, but <strong>it teaches the learner a unique meta-linguistic skill about the language itself, which I haven't seen before. </strong></p>\n<p>Oddly lacking is an introduction to radicals? Or their purpose as well. Therefore, ChineseCUBES, function more from the character-level up towards words and then phrase level.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nWith a price of $149, it is a little bit on the steep side, but ChineseCUBES is a very unique learning product. An iPad app would not be a replacement. The Freestyle Mode is really something else, that can really just exist with Chinese and the way ChineseCUBES implemented it. The Learning Mode falls flat, but the content itself is not bad and quite novel.\n<p>Beginner learners and Elementary learners would definitely benefit out of ChineseCUBES. Here's the thing though, ChineseCUBES is not the most efficient and effective product out there. <a href=\"http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai\">Skritter</a>, <a href=\"http://ankisrs.net\">Anki</a> and other methods are definitely better, but <strong>ChineseCUBES fills a weird a gap between having fun, self-exploration, learning and introducing the learner to the unique aspects of Chinese syntax and vocabulary/phrase formation</strong>, which is definitely something that needs to be learned.</p>\n<p>I would recommend this to people just starting out in Chinese, while using other methods. Spend 10-20min a day with ChineseCUBES in Freestyle mode, and you'll learn a lot of the way the language is structured while picking up new vocabulary.</p>\n<p>With that being said,<strong> <a href=\"http://chinesecubes.com\">ChineseCUBES</a> is not a product that you need to use</strong>, as it does not easily fit in to <a href=\"http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/06/four-strands-language-learning/\">the four strands of language learning</a>. It's a not a sustainable product, such as <a href=\"http://fluentu.com\">FluentU</a> or <a href=\"http://www.skritter.com/?siteref=ConfusedLaowai\">Skritter</a> that can easily fall into a language learning strand, to keep improving skills.

I was instantly intrigued, as it was a novel concept,\nusing blocks with Chinese characters on them with augmented reality. I'm\ndefinitely a promoter for new and exciting ways to learn languages, especially\nwhen it comes to using new technology. Augmented reality has been buzzing for\nthe past two years, especially in mobile phones. I was curious how they will\nimplement this with Chinese characters, so I got sent a copy to review. Here's a\nshort video provided by them on what it's about.\n\nFirst Impressions\n \n[http://res.cloudinary.com/daxztt3th/image/upload/v1412837098/IMG_20121106_093354_x5ujes.jpg]\n\nThe first thing I noticed the amazing packaging and product design that went\ninto ChineseCUBES. It's not some cheap product shoved into a box, but it\nactually has a solid build and design. This gives off a very good first\nimpression. You don't get this in language learning products very often. When I\nopened it, there was a lot more than I expected: manuals, cd's, whiteboard\nmarker, character cardboard square (for writing on), a rectangle black pad to\nput the cubes on as well as a webcam.The addition of the webcam was quite\nsurprising. I expected just to use my own webcam, but then I realized, some\ncomputers, mostly desktops, do not have webcams, so it was a needed addition.\n\nThe Hardware\nNow this is cool part of ChineseCUBES.

I've been here\nnow for three weeks. It's been quite the ride and my blog is way due for an\nupdate!\n\nHere's what I've been up to so far.\n\nTwo Weeks in a Hostel\nMy girlfriend and I arrived in the middle of December. We stayed at a hostel\nright next to Shilin market [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilin_Night_Market].\nIt was busy and chaotic, but we soon adapted. We've been slowly edging our way\ninto all the delicious foods on offer in Taiwan. My first impression of Taipei\nwas a bit mixed. Due to the rainy/humid weather here, most buildings were a bit\nmore grimy and dilapidated than I expected. But I got used to it very quickly.We\nsaw this amazing rainbow one afternoon from our hostel window. [It even made the\nnews that night on TV!]\n\n  [http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/01/taiwan/rainbow/]\n\nMy girlfriend was really lucky in finding a job teaching English to little kids\nquite quickly. I've been hunting for jobs, but have been going slowly. This week\nI'm going to pick up the pace a bit. I've got a few leads to follow up soon. I\nuse Tealit [http://tealit.com]  and then just go schools themselves to ask if\nthey have vacancies.Finding a place to stay\nDuring the two weeks in our hostel, we looked for jobs and also an apartment. By\nsome lucky chance, my girlfriend found this beautiful place with an amazing view\non a random Taiwan classifieds website. The landlord speaks pretty good English.\nThe timing of the previous tenant leaving was perfect for us. We could literally\ngo with our bags from the hostel straight to our new apartment.It is situated in\nZhuwei, which is a suburb of Danshui district in New Taipei. So it's a bit north\nand bit more from the city than I expected to settle in Taipei, but the view and\nmodern facilities is a nice comfort. My girlfriend works close by in any case\nand the subway trains give easy access to the city.\n\nHere's our view:\n\n  [http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/01/taiwan/viewdanshui/]\n\nXmas & New Years Eve\nIt was the first time spending the festive holidays away from my family, so I\nwas a little bit sad. Luckily, I had my girlfriend with me who cheered me up. We\nended up going ice skating at Taipei Arena, which is not our normal Xmas\ntradition. In South Africa it's full on summer during the festive holidays.\nAfter that we went Christmast lights in Banqiao District. \n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/01/taiwan/img_20121231_191815/]\n\nFor New Years Eve, we did not make any plans beforehand as we just moved into\nour new place and have been very busy with exploring and hunting for jobs. We\ndecided to just head down to Taipei 101 and see the fireworks. We heard there\nwere going to be lots of people, but did not expect THAT much people. Wow. It\nwas unreal.\n\nWe wanted to get into a club, but all was sold out and way too expensive. We\njust drank some beers from 7-11 on the street and watched the festivities around\nTaipei 101. The fireworks in the end were beautiful. We then tried to head\nhome... woops. Mistake. We only ended up getting home at 2h30am!\n\nIt did not spoil the evening, but for future reference we will try and organize\nsomething before: like a club, or a party at someone's place.\n\nMeeting up with Jake & Olle\nOne of the big reasons for coming to Taiwan, and specifically Taipei, is because\nI knew that there are like-minded Chinese learners here. Two of these are Olle (\n\nHacking Chinese [http://hackingchinese.com]) on the left & Jake (iLearnMandarin\n[http://ilearnmandarin.blogspot.com]) on the right. \n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/01/taiwan/jakeolle/]\n\nI met up with them in the first week that I was here. We went for some delicious\n热炒 and 啤酒. It's fun to talk about languages and linguistics with them as they\nare both more advanced than I am. I learn a lot. We might consider starting a\nproject in the future. You'll have to wait and see.My Mandarin\nNow here's the topic you're all probably most interested in.For the first three\nweeks, I've been slow in my Mandarin. I'm still settling in and try to find my\nroutine. However, as everyday goes past, the language around me is slowly\nbecoming clearer. It's as if all the knowledge that I have learned up until now\nis slowly waking up and getting ready for action.\n\nThe switch to traditional characters has been no problem for me. I know enough\nsimplified characters to understand the traditional characters in context. I\nstill have to figure out my exact plan of action (I need a job first!), but as\nsoon as I get one I'll let everyone know.\n\nI'm excited for 2013!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-01-07T08:44:36.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2014-10-09T07:44:47.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-01-07T08:44:36.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null},{"id":"5b5998bf1e06cf00189b3c31","uuid":"c0ff4253-6918-4478-9960-c28165e88326","title":"Chinese Character Challenge - Level up!","slug":"chinese-character-challenge-level-up","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"So Olle of <a href=\\\"http://hackingchinese.com\\\">Hacking Chinese</a> decided to drop a bombshell on the first of January, his <a href=\\\"http://www.hackingchinese.com/?p=3145\\\">Chinese character challenge</a>.

It started with my thesis, where I needed to\neasily decompose Chinese characters for my research. I then found data and wrote\na little decomposition tool for myself. This was called HanziJS\n[http://hanzijs.com]. However, as time went on I realized I wanted more than\njust decomposition data. Why not create a site that pushes the value of Chinese\ncharacter dictionaries to a new level?\n\n \n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/01/introducing-hanzicraft/screen-shot-2013-01-10-at-9-52-36-am/]\n\nWhat I mean by this, is that when I want to look up a Chinese character to learn\n(especially for something like the Chinese character challenge\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/01/chinese-character-challenge-level-up/]) I\nwant as much information possible to help me learn that character, especially\nregarding how someradicals affect your reading on a sub-conscious level\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/05/5-ways-chinese-radicals-sub-consciously-trolling/]\n.Questions that come up:\n\n * What are the radicals?\n * How does the decomposition traverse itself?\n * Is there any phonetic information available?\n * Does this character have many definitions? How is it pronounced?\n * Now that I know more of the character, where does it fit into vocabulary?\n * Is the vocabulary useful?\n\nThose questions are the ones that I want answered when it comes to a Chinese\ncharacter dictionary. I have found some sites that can serve such a goal, but\nthey are either badly designed, don't have all the answers and/or is in Chinese\nonly.What will become of HanziJS?\nHanziJS [http://hanzijs.com] is the code behind HanziCraft\n[http://hanzicraft.com]. It is an open-source module\n[http://github.com/nieldlr/hanzi]  for Node.js. This is the backbone. HanziCraft\nis thus an application of the code itself (hopefully other people will create\ntheir own apps with the HanziJS code in the future!).If you are a coder, go\ncheck out the github repo [http://github.com/nieldlr/hanzi]. There's quite a lot\nof updates to it, as well as quite a bit of refactoring (thanks Dusan\n[https://plus.google.com/114101734864850163495/posts]!).

It's mine.\n\nMotivation is still the key\nAs with most things in life, especially, learning languages, motivation is the\nmost powerful tool out there. Here I am in Taiwan, with all the language around\nme, but I'm not progressing as fast enough as I thought I would. It's because\nI'm lazy. Simple as that. During the first month I made a conscious effort to\nlearn more characters, listen to people talk and just absorb as much as I can,\nbut then immersion fatigue set in. It was too much too quickly.Immersion, even\nif the language is all around me, needs the correct mindset and motivation to\nmake it work. Being at an intermediate level makes this even more troublesome,\nbecause I don't really \"need\" to learn more. I can do all survival things\nalready. You need to make the effort, but don't exhaust yourself. Ask yourself\nthis question:\n\nHow I can use all this access and exposure to the language in an efficient way,\nthat's already in line with your own study routines and methods?\nIn there you will find success in immersion. It's one I'm trying to answer\nmyself. What is my goal and how I can use the exposure to the language to my\nbenefit? Don't expect a holy grail. It never works like that.But there's one\nthing that immersion does really well.\n\nListening and more listening!\nOf all the things that immersion allows me to do, that I won't do otherwise is\nspend lots of time on listening. I would never just sit and listen to\nconversations or something mundane like that, because really, who wants to do\nthat? It takes a lot of time. However, here in Taiwan, I get so much listening\npractice for free as part of my everyday routine. Sitting on the train, going to\nshops, hearing my Chinese co-teachers talk. All these add up, which I would not\nhave done otherwise.If you look at the four strands of language learning\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2012/06/four-strands-language-learning/], lots of\ninput is one aspect of it. I feel like other areas of language learning, such as\nwriting, speaking and reading still need inherent motivation to do even if\nyou're in an immersive environment. They take conscious effort. But listening is\nsometimes a tough one to crack, because it takes a lot of time. I feel like if\nthere's one thing that immersion can help you with regardless of motivation is\nlistening to the language a lot more than you would have otherwise. Even if you\ndon't understand everything, it allows to get used to the flow and sound of the\nlanguage.\n\nMy listening is one aspect of immersion, that I feel, has improved as I had\nhoped for.\n\nConclusion\nImmersion is the not answer. You still need motivation to make it work for you.\nListening however, is getting a nice free ride. So use it!How has your immersion\nexperience been?

How do you express the sound of the\nping pong ball bouncing back and forth on the table? After looking through the\ninternet and much research, I wanted to share some of the information I found.\n\nYou would never be able to visit a zoo or sing Old McDonald’s without these:\nanimal sounds!\n\nThe reason I looked into this was because I was texting one of my Chinese\nfriends about my morning. I woke up to the sound my neighbor’s dog barking\nconsistently for fifteen minutes at a squirrel. I wanted to text them “woof” for\nextra measure but didn’t know how to so had to look it up. Turns out, to say\n“woof” in Chinese, is “wang” in pinyin.\n\nHere’s how you can use this word: “我邻居的狗不停地叫，汪汪汪!” - “My neighbor’s dog didn’t\nstop barking, woof, woof, woof!”\n\nThey’re so useful in many occasions, here are some more onomatopoeias for\nanimals!\n\nAnimal Sounds\n嗥/嚎 (háo) - awoo; howl吼 (hǒu) - roar\n哞 (mōu) - moo\n布谷 (bù gǔ) - cuckoo; chirp\n嗷呜 (áo wū) - growl\n嗯昂 (ēn áng) - hee haw\n吱吱 (zhī zhī) - tweet\n咩咩 (miē miē) - baah; bleating\n喵喵 (miāo miāo) - meow\n咯咯 (gē gē) - cluck\n哼哼 (hēng hēng) - oink\n嗡嗡 (wēng wēng) - buzz; hum\n嘶嘶 (sī sī) - hiss\n嘶嘶 (sī sī) - neigh\n吱吱 (zhī zhī) - squeak\n汪汪 (wāng wāng) - woof\n嘎嘎 (gā gā) - quack\n咕咕 (gū gū) - coo\n呱呱 (guā guā) - ribbit\n唧唧 (jī jī) - chirping of insects\n呜呜 (wū wū) - hoot; loud raucous cry (like an owl)\n叽叽喳喳 (jī ji chā chā) - chirp\n喔喔喔 (ō ō ō) - cock-a-doodle-doo; crowOne of the most versatile one character\nexpressions, and my personal favorite is “啪 (pā)” or similar to “pop!” in\nEnglish.

I've been very\nsilent on Confused Laowai, but it's indicative of change. It's almost eight\nmonths now that I've been living in Taipei. So what's been happening? I'll be\ncandid here.\n\nA shift in focus\nIt's been an interesting journey this year. Moving from being a Master's student\nlast year researching spaced repetition systems and Chinese characters to a\nworking as a young adult teaching English in Taipei. It's related yes, but it\ncame with the infamous \"work\" life. I had a bursary last year, but now I have to\nnavigate life by trying to get an income as well. This isn't a post about the\n99%, or of the trials and tribulations of the \"real\" life, but it marks a change\nin my life, that changed my priorities... for now at least.During the day I\nwould do web development, working on projects for my self or contract work, then\nlate afternoon/early evening I would teach English. Learning Chinese, as a\npriority has taken a back seat. I'm focusing more on web development as a\npotential career.\n\nI said this in my immersion post\n[http://confusedlaowai.com/2013/02/immersion-answer-language-learning-problems/]\n, that moving to Taipei has changed my motivation to learn Chinese. Before I\ncame here, moving to Taipei was my goal. I wanted to improve my Chinese as much\nas possible so that I can function in the society. When I arrived, I realized I\ncould function pretty well and the intense focus on the language was downgraded.\n\nWhere to now?\nMy immediate Chinese goals are non-existent. I try and focus as much as possible\non the environment. My listening has improved the most. Being at the\nintermediate level of any language is a tough place to be. You have to find your\nmotivation to push yourself to fluency. At the moment, I'm still trying to find\nthis. Some people have romantic partners or will use Chinese in a professional\nenvironment, I don't have any of these aspirations. The best idea I can think of\nto slowly delegate an activity I enjoy in English to Chinese. Maybe something\nliking reading? Or watching movies?In any case, as this change happened (and\nstill happening) this year, I'm not going to stop learning Chinese. This\nlanguage has changed me and I won't just discard it. I just have to find\nsomething else. Motivation is integral to learning a language, if not the most\nimportant element.\n\nHabits and motivation will change. This is a challenge. How do you change with\nit, that's the question here? I've just been slow in trying to figure this out.\nBut I promise I will! Developing HanziCraft [http://hanzicraft.com]  for example\nhas been great in mixing web development and learning Chinese.\n\nLife in Taiwan\nTaiwan is an amazing country. It's incredibly easy to live here. Even though I\nwork on Saturdays, we spend most weekends traveling and sightseeing. Summer is\nincredibly hot though. Even hotter than South Africa! It was unbearable at\nfirst, but now I've gotten used to it.

There are many reasons for this: convenience, interest, personality and more!\\n\\nI've always enjoyed Chinese characters. It was the one part of Chinese that really stood out for me at first. It was just incredible to see such a different script, and learn to understand the uniqueness of it. That's why I did my Master's research in learning Chinese characters, and also created [Hanzicraft](http://hanzicraft.com).\\n\\nThis lead me to outpace my reading & character recognition way beyond my other skills.\\n\\nHowever, now that I've started up with my learning again, I want to balance things out a bit more.

There are a few motivations for this:\\n\\n1) Right now it's a bit tricky for me to find a way & time to practice my speaking. Spending a bit each morning listening to content fits really well with my current routine.\\n2) Understanding spoken Chinese is something that I feel could give me a nice confidence boost when moving towards to speaking + writing.\\n3) I would love to be able to consume more native speaking level content without feeling completely lost.\\n\\n### Goal\\n\\nWhen it comes to a goal I would like to achieve, it is the last point mentioned above: be more comfortable in consuming native speaking content.\\n\\nI remember in 2012 watching [那些年，我們一起追的女孩](http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%9B%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E5%80%91%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%B7%E8%BF%BD%E7%9A%84%E5%A5%B3%E5%AD%A9) and being so lost. After living in Taipei last year, the movie feels a lot better, but I realize that I still rely a lot on reading the Chinese subtitles. This is something I want to move away from, at least in a way to increase my listening skill.s\\n\\nI took part in [Hacking Chinese's listening challenge](http://challenges.hackingchinese.com/challenges/5-extensive-listening-challenge-october-2014) in October. This was a great way to flex those listening and push myself. I failed with my goal of 10 hours in 3 weeks.
